# Entity Relationship Model
- Basis of an entity relationship diagram (ERD) 
- ERD depicts the:
	- Conceptual database as viewed by end user
	- Database’s main components
		- Entities
		- Attributes
		- Relationships
- Entity - Refers to the entity set and not to a single entity occurrence

### Attributes
- Characteristics of entities
- `Required attribute`: Must have a value, cannot be left empty
- `Optional attribute`: Does not require a value, can be left empty
- Domain - Set of possible values for a given attribute
- Identifiers: One or more attributes that uniquely identify each entity instance
- `Composite identifier`: Primary key composed of more than one attribute
- `Composite attribute`: Attribute that can be subdivided to yield additional attributes
- `Simple attribute`: Attribute that cannot be subdivided
- `Single-valued attribute`: Attribute that has only a single value
- `Multivalued attributes`: Attributes that have many values
- `Multivalued attributes`: Attributes that have many values and require creating:
	- Several new attributes, one for each component of the original multivalued attribute
	- A new entity composed of the original multivalued attribute’s components
- `Derived attribute`: Attribute whose value is calculated from other attributes
	- Derived using an algorithm

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Storing Derived Attributes

### Relationships
- Association between entities that always operate in both directions
- `Participants`: Entities that participate in a relationship
- `Connectivity`: Describes the relationship classification
- `Cardinality`: Expresses the minimum and maximum number of entity occurrences associated with one occurrence of related entity

### Existence dependence
- Existence dependence : Entity exists in the database only when it is associated with another related entity occurrence
- Existence independence : 
	- Entity exists apart from all of its related entities
	- Referred to as a strong entity or regular entity

### Relationship Strength

### A Weak (Non-Identifying) Relationship between COURSE and CLASS

### A Strong (Identifying) Relationship between COURSE and CLASS

### Weak Entity
- Conditions 
	- Existence-dependent 
	- Has a primary key that is partially or totally derived from parent entity in the relationship
- Database designer determines whether an entity is weak based on business rules

### COURSE and CLASS in a Mandatory Relationship

### Relationship Degree
- Indicates the number of entities or participants associated with a relationship
- `Unary relationship`: Association is maintained within a single entity 
	- `Recursive relationship`: Relationship exists between occurrences of the same entity set
- `Binary relationship`: Two entities are associated
- `Ternary relationship`: Three entities are associated

### Three Types of Relationship Degree

### An ER Representation of Recursive Relationships

### Associative Entities
- Also known as composite or bridge entities
- Used to represent an M:N relationship between two or more entities
- Is in a 1:M relationship with the parent entities
	- Composed of the primary key attributes of each parent entity
- May also contain additional attributes that play no role in connective process

### Developing an ER Diagram
- Create a detailed narrative of the organization’s  description of operations
- Identify business rules based on the descriptions
- Identify main entities and relationships from the business rules
- Develop the initial ERD
- Identify the attributes and primary keys that adequately describe entities
- Revise and review ERD
