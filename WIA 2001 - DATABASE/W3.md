## Relational Data Model

- `Primary key (PK)`:  Attribute or combination of attributes that uniquely identifies any given row
- `Functional dependence`: Value of one or more attributes determines the value of one or more other attributes
	- `Determinant`: Attribute whose value determines another
	- `Dependent`: Attribute whose value is determined by the other attribute
- `Full functional dependence`: Entire collection of attributes in the determinant is necessary for the relationship

### Types of Keys

+ `Composite key`: Key that is composed of more than one attribute
+ `Key attribute`: Attribute that is a part of a key
+ `Entity integrity`: Condition in which each row in thetable has its own unique identity
	- All of the values in the primary key must be unique
	- No key attribute in the primary key can contain a null
+ `Null`: Absence of any data value that could represent:
	- An unknown attribute value
	- A known, but missing, attribute value
	- A inapplicable condition
+ `Referential integrity`: Every reference to an entity instance by another entity instance is valid

### Relational Database Keys
- `Superkey` : An attribute or combination of attributes that uniquely identifies each row in a table
- `Candidate key`: A minimal (irreducible) superkey ; a superkey that does not contain a subset of attributes that is itself a superkey
- `Primary key`: A candidate key selected to uniquely identify all other attribute value in any given row ;cannot contain null entries
- `Foreign key`: An attribute or combination of attributes in one table whose values must either match the primary key in another table or be null

## Data Model

`Data modeling`: Iterative and progressive process of creating a specific data model for a determined problem domain

• `Data models`: Simple representations of complex real-world data structures
	• Useful for supporting a specific problem domain
• `Model` - Abstraction of a real-world object or event
