# **NORMALIZATION**

- Evaluating and correcting table structures to minimize data redundancies
- Reduces data anomalies
- Assigns attributes to tables based on determination
- Normal forms
	- First normal form (1NF)
	- Second normal form (2NF)
	- Third normal form (3NF)
	-  Higher normal forms are better than lower normal forms
	-  2NF is better than 1NF; 3NF is better than 2NF
	-  For most business database design purposes, 3NF is as high as needed in normalization
	-  Highest level of normalization is not always most desirable
- `Denormalization`: Produces a lower normal form
	- Result in increased performance an greater data redundancy


### Need for Normalization
- Used while designing a new database structure\
	- Analyzes the relationship among the attributes within each entity
	- Determines if the structure can be improved
- Improves the existing data structure and creates an appropriate database design

### Normalization Process
- Objective is to ensure that each table conforms to the concept of well-formed
	relations
	- Each table represents a single subject
	- No data item will be unnecessarily stored in more than one table
	- All nonprime attributes in a table are dependent on the primary key
	- Each table is void of insertion, update, and deletion anomalies
- Ensures that all tables are in at least 3NF
- Higher forms are not likely to be encountered in business environment
- Works one relation at a time
- Starts by : 
	- Identifying the dependencies of a relation (table)
	- Progressively breaking the relation into new set of relations

| Normal Form | Characteristic                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1NF         | Table format , no repeating groups , and PK identified |
| 2NF         | 1NF and no partial dependencies                        |
| 3NF         | 2NF and no transitive dependencies                     |
| BCNF        | Every determinant is a candidate key                   |
| 4NF         | 3NF and no independant multivalued dependecies         |
|             |                                                        |

### Functional Dependence Concept 
- `Functional dependence` : The attribute B is fully functionally dependent on the attribute A if each value of A determines one and only one value of B.
- `Function dependence ( Generalization definition)` : Attribute A determines attributes B if all of the rows in the table that agree in value for attribute A also agree in value for attribute B
- `Fully functional dependence (composite key)` : If attribute B is functionally dependent on a composite key A but not on any Subset of that composite key, the attribute B is fully functionally dependent on A


### Types of Functional Dependencies
- `Partial dependency` :  Functional dependence in which  the determinant is only part of the primary key
	- Assumption - One candidate key
	- Straight forward
	- Easy to identify
- `Transitive dependency `:  An attribute functionally depends on another non-key attribute

### Conversion to 1NF
- `Repeating group` :  Group of multiple entries of same type can exist for any single key attribute occurrence
	- Existence proves the presence of data redundancies
- Enable reducing data redundancies
- Steps 
	- Eliminate the repeating groups
	- Identify the primary key
	- Identify all dependencies
- `Dependency diagram` 
	-  Depicts all dependencies found within given table structure
	- Helps to get an overview of all relationships among table's attributes
	- Makes it less likely that an important dependency will be overlooked
- 1NF describes tabular format in which : 
	- All key attributes are defined
	- There are no repeating groups in the table
	- All attributes are dependent on the primary key
- All relational tables satisfy 1NF requirements
- Some tables conation partial dependencies
	- Subject to data redundancies and various anomalies
### Conversion to 2NF
- Make new tables to eliminate partial dependencies
	- Write Each Key Component on a Separate Line
	- write original ( composite) key on last line
	- each component will become key in new table
	- determine those attributes that are dependent on other attributes
- Table is in 2NF when it is in 1NF and has no partial dependencies
	- no attribute is dependent on only portion of primary key

### Conversion to 3NF
- Steps : 
	- Make new tables to eliminate transitive dependencies
	- identify each new determinant . For every transitive dependency , write its determinant as PK for new table
		- `Determinant ` : Any attribute whose value determines other values within a row
	- Reassign corresponding dependent attibutes
- Table is in 3NF when it :
	- is in 2NF
	- Contains no transitive dependencies

### Requirements for Good Normalized Set of Tables
- Evaluate PK assignments and naming conventions
- Refine attribute atomicity 
	- `Atomic attribute` : cannot be further subdivided
	- `Atomicity` : Characteristic of an atomic attribute
- Identify new attributes and new relationships
- Refine primary keys as required for data granularity
	- `Granularity` :  level of detail represented by the values stored in a table's row
- maintain historical accuracy and evaluate using derived attributes

### Surrogate Keys
- Used by designers when the primary key is considered to be unsuitable
- System-defined attribute
- Create and managed via the DBMS
- Have a numeric value which is automatically incremented for each new row

### Normalization and Database Design
- Normalization should be part of the design process
- Proposed entities must meet required the normal form before table structures are created
- Principles and normalization procedures to be understood to redesign and modify databases
	- ERD is created through an iterative process
	- Normalization focuses on the characteristics of specific entities

### Denormalization
- Design goals 
	- Creation of normalized relations
	- Processing requirements and speed
- Number of database tables expands when tables are decomposed to conform to normalization requirements
- Joining a larger number of tables : 
	- takes additional input/ output operations and processing logic
	- reduced system speed
- Defects in unnormalized tables
	- Data updates are less efficient because tables are larger
	- Indexing is more cumbersome
	- No simple strategies for creating virtual tables known as views
