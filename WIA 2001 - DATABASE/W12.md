## Transaction Management and Concurrency Control

### Transaction
-  Logical unit of work that must be entirely completed or aborted
- Consists of:
	- `SELECT` statement 
	- Series of related `UPDATE` statements
	- Series of `INSERT` statements
	- Combination of `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `INSERT` statements

-  `Consistent database state`: All data integrity constraints are satisfied
	- Must begin with the database in a known consistent state to ensure consistency

- Formed by two or more database requests
	- `Database requests`: Equivalent of a single SQL statement in an application program or transaction

- Consists of a single SQL statement or a collection of related SQL statements

### Evaluating Transaction Results
- Not all transactions update database
	- SQL code represents a transaction because it accesses a database
- Improper or incomplete transactions can have devastating effect on database integrity
	- Users can define enforceable constraints based on business rules
	- Other integrity rules are automatically enforced by the DBMS

### Transaction Properties
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250202173955.png)
> ACIDS 

### Transaction Management with SQL
- SQL statements that provide transaction support
	- `COMMIT` 
	- `ROLLBACK`
- Transaction sequence must continue until:
	- `COMMIT` statement is reached
	- `ROLLBACK` statement is reached
	- End of program is reached
	- Program is abnormally terminated
>CREP
### Transaction Log
- Keeps track of all transactions that update the database
- DBMS uses the information stored in a log for:
	- `Recovery` requirement triggered by a ROLLBACK statement
	- A program’s `abnormal` termination
	- A system `failure`

### Concurrency Control
- `Coordination` of the `simultaneous` transactions execution in a `multiuser` database system
- Objective - Ensures `serializability` of transactions in a multiuser database environment

### Problems in Concurrency Control
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250202174159.png)
> LUI
### The Scheduler
- Establishes the `order` in which the operations are executed within concurrent transactions 
	- Interleaves the execution of database operations to ensure serializability and isolation of transactions
- Based on `concurrent control algorithms` to determine the appropriate order
- Creates serialization schedule 
	- `Serializable schedule`: Interleaved execution of transactions yields the same results as the serial execution of the transactions

### Concurrency Control with Locking Methods
- `Locking methods` - Facilitate isolation of data items used in concurrently executing transactions 
- `Lock`: Guarantees `exclusive` use of a data item to a current transaction
- `Pessimistic locking`: Use of locks based on the assumption that conflict between transactions is likely
- `Lock manager`: Responsible for assigning and policing the locks used by the transactions

### Lock Granularity
- Indicates the `level` of lock use
- Levels of locking 
	- Database-level lock
	- Table-level lock
	- Page-level lock
		- Page or diskpage: Directly addressable section of a disk
	- Row-level lock
	- Field-level lock

### Problems in Using Locks
- Resulting transaction schedule might not be `serializable`
- Schedule might create `deadlocks`

### Two-Phase Locking (2PL)
- Defines how transactions acquire and relinquish locks
- Guarantees `serializability` but does not prevent deadlocks 
- Phases
	- `Growing phase` - Transaction acquires all required locks without unlocking any data
	- `Shrinking phase` - Transaction releases all locks and cannot obtain any new lock
- Governing rules
	- Two transactions cannot have conflicting locks
	- No unlock operation can precede a lock operation in the same transaction
	- No data are affected until all locks are obtained

### Figure 10.7 - Two-Phase Locking Protocol
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250202174731.png)

### Deadlocks
- Occurs when two transactions wait indefinitely for each other to unlock data
	- Known as deadly embrace
- Control techniques
	- Deadlock prevention 
	- Deadlock detection 
	- Deadlock avoidance 
- Choice of deadlock control method depends on database environment

### Table 10.13 - How a Deadlock Condition is Created

### Time Stamping
- Assigns global, unique time stamp to each transaction
	- Produces explicit order in which transactions are submitted to DBMS
- Properties
	- `Uniqueness`: Ensures no equal time stamp values exist
	- `Monotonicity`: Ensures time stamp values always increases
- Disadvantages
	- Each value stored in the database requires two additional stamp fields
	- Increases memory needs
	- Increases the database’s processing overhead
	- Demands a lot of system resources

### Concurrency Control with Optimistic Methods
- `Optimistic approach`: Based on the assumption that the majority of database operations do not conflict
	- Does not require locking or time stamping techniques
	- Transaction is executed without restrictions until it is committed

### Phases of Optimistic Approach

### Database Recovery Management 
- `Database recovery`: Restores database from a given state to a previously consistent state
- Recovery transactions are based on the atomic transaction property
	- `Atomic transaction property`: All portions of a transaction must be treated as a single logical unit of work
		- If transaction operation cannot be completed:
			- Transaction must be `aborted`
			- Changes to database must be `rolled back`

### Recovery Process in Deferred-Write Technique
- Identify the last check point in the transaction log
- If transaction was committed before the last check point
	- Nothing needs to be done
- If transaction was committed after the last check point
	- Transaction log is used to `redo` the transaction
- If transaction had a ROLLBACK operation after the last check point 
	- Nothing needs to be done

### Recovery Process in Write-Through Technique
- Identify the last checkpoint in the transaction log
- If transaction was committed before the last check point 
	- Nothing needs to be done
- If transaction was committed after the last checkpoint
	- Transaction must be `redone`
- If transaction had a ROLLBACK operation after the last check point 
	- Transaction log is used to ROLLBACK the operations

## DETAIL CHATGPT SUMMARY

Let’s go through each topic in detail:

---

### **1. Transaction Overview**

A **transaction** is the smallest logical unit of work in a database. It can consist of one or more SQL statements that must be executed completely or not at all. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to ensure data consistency.

#### **Properties of Transactions (ACID):**

1. **Atomicity:**
    
    - Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit.
    - Either all operations within the transaction are completed or none are.
    - Example: Transferring money between two accounts must debit one account and credit the other. If either operation fails, the transaction is rolled back.
2. **Consistency:**
    
    - Ensures the database transitions from one valid state to another.
    - All integrity constraints (e.g., foreign keys, unique constraints) must be satisfied.
    - Example: A transaction cannot violate a unique constraint on a primary key.
3. **Isolation:**
    
    - Transactions are executed as if they are the only operations running in the system.
    - Prevents interference between concurrent transactions.
    - Example: If two users are booking the last seat in a theater, isolation ensures only one succeeds.
4. **Durability:**
    
    - Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even if the system crashes.
    - Example: After transferring money, the new account balances persist in the database.

---

### **2. Transaction Management with SQL**

- **COMMIT:** Permanently saves all changes made during the transaction.
    
    - Example: After a successful update, use `COMMIT` to make changes permanent.
- **ROLLBACK:** Reverts all changes made in the transaction.
    
    - Example: If an error occurs during an update, use `ROLLBACK` to undo changes.
- **Transaction Sequence:**
    
    - A transaction can end in one of the following ways:
        1. Commit successfully.
        2. Rollback on error.
        3. Program ends without saving.
        4. System crash or abnormal termination.

---

### **3. Transaction Log**

The **transaction log** is a critical feature of the DBMS that keeps a detailed record of all changes made during a transaction. It ensures recoverability.

#### **Contents of the Log:**

1. Transaction start and end times.
2. Operations performed (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE).
3. Previous and new values of data.
4. Commit or rollback status.

#### **Uses:**

- Recovery during system failure.
- Undoing changes using rollback.
- Redoing operations after a crash.

---

### **4. Concurrency Control**

Concurrency control ensures consistent and correct results when multiple transactions execute simultaneously in a multi-user environment.

#### **Common Problems:**

1. **Lost Updates:**
    
    - Occurs when two transactions overwrite each other’s changes.
    - Example: Two users editing the same row in a table simultaneously.
2. **Uncommitted Data:**
    
    - Occurs when one transaction reads uncommitted changes made by another.
    - Example: A transaction updates a row but is rolled back, leaving another transaction with invalid data.
3. **Inconsistent Retrievals:**
    
    - Occurs when a transaction reads partial data from another ongoing transaction.
    - Example: Reading a total sales figure while another transaction is updating sales records.

#### **The Scheduler:**

- Manages the execution order of transactions to ensure **serializability**, where the results are the same as if transactions were executed one by one.

---

### **5. Locking Methods**

Locks control access to data during concurrent transactions to ensure isolation.

#### **Lock Granularity:**

1. **Database-level lock:** Locks the entire database.
    - Rarely used due to high overhead.
2. **Table-level lock:** Locks an entire table.
    - Suitable for bulk updates but can block other users.
3. **Page-level lock:** Locks a portion of the database (e.g., a disk page).
    - Balances concurrency and isolation.
4. **Row-level lock:** Locks a specific row.
    - Ideal for high concurrency but increases overhead.
5. **Field-level lock:** Locks a specific field in a row.
    - Very granular but rarely used due to complexity.

#### **Types of Locks:**

- **Binary Lock:** Locked (1) or unlocked (0).
- **Exclusive Lock:** Prevents access by other transactions.
- **Shared Lock:** Allows read access but prevents writes.

---

### **6. Two-Phase Locking Protocol (2PL)**

2PL is a protocol to ensure serializability by managing how locks are acquired and released.

#### **Phases:**

1. **Growing Phase:**
    
    - A transaction acquires all necessary locks.
    - No locks are released during this phase.
2. **Shrinking Phase:**
    
    - A transaction releases all locks.
    - No new locks can be acquired.

#### **Drawback:**

- **Deadlocks:** Two transactions block each other indefinitely, waiting for locks to be released.

---

### **7. Deadlocks**

A **deadlock** occurs when two or more transactions are stuck, each waiting for the other to release a lock.

#### **Control Techniques:**

1. **Prevention:** Design the system to avoid conditions that lead to deadlocks.
2. **Detection:** Identify and resolve deadlocks when they occur.
3. **Avoidance:** Use algorithms to decide if granting a lock will lead to a deadlock.

---

### **8. Timestamping**

Timestamping assigns unique timestamps to each transaction, determining the order in which they should be executed.

#### **Advantages:**

- Avoids locking mechanisms.
- Provides a clear transaction order.

#### **Disadvantages:**

- Requires extra memory for timestamps.
- Increases system overhead.

---

### **9. Optimistic Concurrency Control**

Assumes most transactions do not conflict and avoids locking mechanisms.

#### **Phases:**

1. **Read Phase:** Transaction reads data and makes changes in a private workspace.
2. **Validation Phase:** Ensures changes will not conflict with other transactions.
3. **Write Phase:** Changes are permanently applied.

---

### **10. Database Recovery Management**

Recovery ensures the database returns to a consistent state after a failure.

#### **Techniques:**

1. **Deferred-Write:**
    
    - Changes are logged but not applied until the transaction is committed.
    - Minimizes risks of partial updates.
2. **Write-Through:**
    
    - Updates are immediately applied to the database.
    - Ensures data durability but increases overhead.

#### **Recovery Process:**

- Identify the last checkpoint.
- Redo committed transactions after the checkpoint.
- Rollback uncommitted transactions.
