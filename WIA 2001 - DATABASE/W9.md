## Introduction to Structured Query Language
- Categories of SQL function
	- Data definition language (DDL)
	- Data manipulation language (DML)
- Nonprocedural language with basic command vocabulary set of less than 100 words
- Differences in SQL dialects are minor

### The Database Model
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250203012551.png)

### Tasks to be Completed Before Using a New RDBMS
- Create database structure
	- RDBMS creates physical files that will hold database
	- Differs from one RDBMS to another
- `Authentication`: Process DBMS uses to verify that only registered users access the data
	- Required for the creation tables
	- User should log on to RDBMS using user ID and password created by database administrator


### The Database Schema
- Logical group of database objects related to each other
- Command 
	- CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION {creator};
		- Seldom used directly

### Common SQL Data Types

### Creating Table Structures
- Use one line per column (attribute) definition
- Use spaces to line up attribute characteristics and constraints
- Table and attribute names are capitalized
- Features of table creating command sequence
	- NOT NULL specification
	- UNIQUE specification
- Syntax to create table
	- CREATE TABLE tablename();

### Primary Key and Foreign Key
- Primary key attributes contain both a NOT NULL and a UNIQUE specification
- RDBMS will automatically enforce referential integrity for foreign keys
- Command sequence ends with semicolon
- ANSI SQL allows use of following clauses to cover CASCADE, SET NULL, or SET DEFAULT
	- ON DELETE and ON UPDATE


### SQL Constraints
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250203012904.png)

### SQL Indexes
- When primary key is declared, DBMS automatically creates unique index
- Composite index:
	- Is based on two or more attributes
	- Prevents data duplication
- Syntax to create SQL indexes
	- CREATE INDEX indexname ON tablename();
- Syntax to delete an index
	- DROP INDEX indexname;

### Data Manipulation Commands

### Inserting Table Rows with a SELECT Subquery
- Syntax
	- INSERT INTO tablename SELECT columnlist FROM tablename
- Used to add multiple rows using another table as source
- SELECT command - Acts as a subquery and is executed first
	- Subquery: Query embedded/nested inside another query

### Selecting Rows Using Conditional Restrictions
- Following syntax enables to specify which rows to select
	- SELECT columnlist
	- FROM tablelist
	- WHERE conditionlist;
- Used to select partial table contents by placing restrictions on the rows
- Optional WHERE clause 
	- Adds conditional restrictions to the SELECT statement

### Comparison Operators
- Add conditional restrictions on selected table contents
- Used on:
	- Character attributes
	- Dates

### Comparison Operators: Computed Columns and Column Aliases
- SQL accepts any valid expressions/formulas in the computed columns
- `Alias`: Alternate name given to a column or table in any SQL statement to improve the readability
- Computed column, an alias, and date arithmetic can be used in a single query
- https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alias.asp

### Arithmetic operators
- The Rule of Precedence: Establish the order in which computations are completed
- Perform:
	- Operations within parentheses
	- Power operations
	- Multiplications and divisions
	- Additions and subtractions

### The Arithmetic Operators

### Selected PRODUCT Table Attributes: The logical OR

### Special Operators

### Advanced Data Definition Commands
- ALTER TABLE command: To make changes in the table structure
- Keywords use with the command
	- ADD - Adds a column
	- MODIFY - Changes column characteristics
	- DROP - Deletes a column
- Used to:
	- Add table constraints
	- Remove table constraints

### Changing Column’s Data Type
- ALTER can be used to change data type
- Some RDBMSs do not permit changes to data types unless column is empty
- Syntax –
	- ALTER TABLE tablename MODIFY (columnname(datatype));
	- https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alter.asp

### Changing Column’s Data Characteristics
- Use ALTER to change data characteristics
- Changes in column’s characteristics are permitted if changes do not alter the existing data type
- Syntax
	- ALTER TABLE tablename MODIFY (columnname(characteristic));

### Adding Column, Dropping Column
- Adding a column
	- Use ALTER and ADD
	- Do not include the NOT NULL clause for new column
- Dropping a column
	- Use ALTER and DROP
	- Some RDBMSs impose restrictions on the deletion of an attribute


### Advanced Data Updates
- UPDATE command updates only data in existing rows
- If a relationship is established between entries and existing columns, the relationship can assign values to appropriate slots
- Arithmetic operators are useful in data updates
- In Oracle, ROLLBACK command undoes changes made by last two UPDATE statements

### Copying Parts of Tables
- SQL permits copying contents of selected table columns
	- Data need not be reentered manually into newly created table(s)
- Table structure is created
- Rows are added to new table using rows from another table

### Adding Primary and Foreign Key Designations
- ALTER TABLE command
	- Followed by a keyword that produces the specific change one wants to make
	- Options include ADD, MODIFY, and DROP
- Syntax to add or modify columns
	- ALTER TABLE tablename
		- {ADD | MODIFY} ( columnname datatype  {ADD | MODIFY} columnname datatype] ) ;
	- ALTER TABLE tablename
		- ADD constraint  ADD constraint ] ;

### Deleting a Table from the Database
- DROP TABLE: Deletes table from database
	- Syntax - DROP TABLE tablename;
- Can drop a table only if it is not the one side of any relationship
	- RDBMS generates a foreign key integrity violation error message if the table is dropped

### Additional SELECT Query Keywords
- Logical operators work well in the query environment
- SQL provides useful functions that:
	- Counts
	- Find minimum and maximum values
	- Calculate averages
- SQL allows user to limit queries to entries:
	- Having no duplicates
	- Whose duplicates may be grouped

### Ordering a Listing
- `ORDER BY` clause is useful when listing order is important
- Syntax - SELECT columnlist FROM tablelist WHERE conditionlist] ORDER BY columnlist ASC | DESC]];
- `Cascading order sequence`: Multilevel ordered sequence 
	- Created by listing several attributes after the ORDER BY clause

### Listing Unique Values
- `DISTINCT` clause: Produces list of values that are unique
- Syntax - SELECT DISTINCT columnlist FROM tablelist;
- Access places nulls at the top of the list
	- Oracle places it at the bottom
	- Placement of nulls does not affect list contents

### Grouping Data
- Frequency distributions created by GROUP BY clause within SELECT statement
- Syntax - SELECT columnlist
		FROM tablelist WHERE conditionlist GROUP BY columnlist HAVING conditionlist ORDER BY columnlist ASC | DESC;

### HAVING Clause
- Extension of GROUP BY feature
- Applied to output of GROUP BY operation
- Used in conjunction with GROUP BY clause in second SQL command set
- Similar to WHERE clause in SELECT statement

### Joining Database Tables
- Performed when data are retrieved from more than one table at a time
	- Equality comparison between foreign key and primary key of related tables
- Tables are joined by listing tables in FROM clause of SELECT statement
	- DBMS creates Cartesian product of every table in the FROM clause

### Joining Tables With an Alias
-  Alias identifies the source table from which data are taken
- Any legal table name can be used as alias
- Add alias after table name in FROM clause
	- FROM tablename alias

### Recursive Joins
- Recursive query: Table is joined to itself using alias
- Use aliases to differentiate the table from itself
