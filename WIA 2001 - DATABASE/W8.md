## Database Design

### The Information System
- Provides for data collection, storage, and retrieval
- Composed of:
	- People, hardware, software
	- Database(s), application programs, procedures
- `Systems analysis`: Process that establishes need for and extent of information system
- `Systems development`: Process of creating information system

### Performance Factors of an Information System
