## Database Design

### The Information System
- Provides for data collection, storage, and retrieval
- Composed of:
	- People, hardware, software
	- Database(s), application programs, procedures
- `Systems analysis`: Process that establishes need for and extent of information system
- `Systems development`: Process of creating information system

### Performance Factors of an Information System
- Database design and implementation
- Application design and implementation
- Administrative procedures
- Database development: `Process` of database design and its implementation

### Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Traces history of an information system
- Provides a picture within which database design and application development are mapped out and evaluated
- Iterative rather than sequential process

### Computer-Aided Systems Engineering (CASE)
- Tool that produces:
	- Time and cost-effective systems
	- Structured, documented, and standardized applications

### The Database Life Cycle (DBLC)

### Purpose of Database Initial Study
- Analyze company situation
- Define problems and constraints
- Define objectives 
- Define scope and boundaries

### A Summary of Activities in the Database Initial Study

### Database Design
- Supports company’s operations and objectives
- Checks the ultimate final product from all perspectives
- Design Pointers for examining completion procedures
	- Data component is an element of whole system
	- System analysts/programmers design procedures to convert data into information
	- Database design is an iterative process

### Database Design Process
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250202151343.png)

### Implementation and Loading
1. Install the DBMS
	- Virtualization: Creates logical representations of computing resources independent of underlying physical computing resources
2. Create the databases
	- Requires the creation of special storage-related constructs to house the end user tables
3. Load or convert the data
	- Requires aggregating data from multiple sources

### Testing Factors
1. Physical security
2. Password security
3. Access rights
4. Audit trails
5. Data encryption
6. Diskless workstations
7. Optimization

### Levels of Database Backups
- Full backup/dump: All database objects are backed up in their entirety
- Differential backup: Only modified/updated objects since last full backup are backed up
- Transaction log backup: Only the transaction log operations that are not reflected in a previous backup are backed up
- Backups are provided with high security

### Sources of Database Failure
- Software
- Hardware
- Programming exemptions
- Transactions
- External factors

### Periodic Maintenance Activities
- Preventive maintenance (backup)
- Corrective maintenance (recovery)
- Adaptive maintenance
- Assignment of access permissions and their maintenance for new and old users
- Generation of database access statistics 
- Periodic security audits 
- Periodic system-usage summaries

### Parallel Activities in the DBLC and the SDLC

### Conceptual Design
- Designs a database independent of database software and physical details
- Conceptual data model - Describes main data entities, attributes, relationships, and constrains
- Designed as software and hardware independent
- Minimum data rule: All that is needed is there, and all that is there is needed

### Conceptual Design Steps
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250202151927.png)

### Description of Operations
- Provides precise, up-to-date, and reviewed description of activities defining organization’s operating environment

### Developing the Conceptual Model Using ER Diagrams

### ER Modelling is an Iterative Process Based on Many Activities

### Conceptual Design Tools and Information Sources

### Data Model Verification

### Iterative ER Model Verification Process

### Cohesivity and Module Coupling
- `Cohesivity`: Strength of the relationships among the module’s entities
- `Module coupling`: Extent to which modules are independent to one another
	- Low coupling decreases unnecessary inter module dependencies

### Distributed Database Design
- Portions of database may reside in different physical locations
- Database fragment: Subset of a database stored at a given location
- Ensures database integrity, security, and performance

### Factors Affecting Software Purchasing Decision
- Cost
- DBMS features and tools
- Underlying model
- Portability
- DBMS hardware requirements

### Logical and Physical Design
- `Logical design`: Designs an enterprise-wide database that is based on a specific data model but independent of physical-level details
- Validates logical model:
	- Using normalization
	- Integrity constraints
	- Against user requirements
- `Physical design`: Process of data storage organization and data access characteristics of the database

### Logical Design Steps

### Mapping the Conceptual Model to the Relational Model

### Physical Design Steps

### Term
- Clustered Tables : Technique that stores related rows from two related tables in adjacent data blocks on disk
- Database Role : Set of database privileges that could be assigned as a unit to a user or group


### Top-down vs. Bottom-up Design Sequencing
