**27. In which TCP attack is the cybercriminal attempting to overwhelm a target host with half-open TCP connections?**

- port scan attack
- **SYN flood attack**
- session hijacking attack
- reset attack

**Explanation:**Â In a TCP SYN flood attack, the attacker sends to the target host a continuous flood of TCP SYN session requests with a spoofed source IP address. The target host responds with a TCP-SYN-ACK to each of the SYN session requests and waits for a TCP ACK that will never arrive. Eventually the target is overwhelmed with half-open TCP connections.
