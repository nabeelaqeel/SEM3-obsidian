- Tunneling is different from VPN because it use dedicated route while VPN go to internet

### Common VPN Protocol
- PPTP Microsoft  
- OpenVPN
- IKEv2 / IPsec
- SoftEther
- WireGuard

### VPN security function
- Encryption 
	- AES
- Hashing
	- SHA
- Authentication
	- Preshared Keys or Certificates
- Anti-Relay
	- Assign serial numbers on packets
## asymmetric encryption

- **keeps data secure by using cryptographic algorithms to generate a pair of keys: a public key and a private key**

### Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithm

- **a method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public communications channel**


### Three Way Encyption


Hashing vs Encryption – **Hashing refers to permanent data conversion into message digest while encryption works in two ways, which can encode and decode the data**.
