# Resource

- Resource and Priorities
	- Project network times are not schedule until resources have been assigned 
		- The implicit assumption is that resource will be available in the required amounts when needed.
		- Adding new projects requires making realistic judgement of resource availability and project durations
	- Cost estimates are not a budge until the have been time-phased

## Resource Problem

1. Resource Smoothing ( or Leveling)
- Involves attempting to even out varying demands on resources by using slack (delaying noncritical activities) to manage resource utilization when resources are adequate over the life of the project .

2. Resource-Constrained Scheduling
- The duration ..

## Types of Project Constraints

1. Technical or Logic Constraint
- One activities depends on others
3. Physical Constraint
- Ex : 1 programmer has to handle many project
5. Resource Constraint


### Constraints Example

### Classification of Scheduling Problem

1. Classification of Problem
2. Time-Constrained Project
3. Resource-Constrained Project

### Resource Allocation Method
1. Limiting Assumptions
2. Risk Assumptions
- More slack , less risk
#### Time-Constrained Projects

Ex : Botanical Garden

#### Resource Demand Leveling Techniques for Time-Constrained Projects

- Advantages : 
	- Peak resource demand are reduced
	- Resources over the life of project are reduced
	- Fluctuation in resource demand is minimized
- Disadvantages :


### Resource-Constraint Projects

- Resources are limited in quantity or availability

Ex :

### The impacts of Resource-Constrained Scheduling
- Reduces delay but reduces flexibility


## Splitting
- Scheduling techniques for a creating a better project schedule and /or increase resource utilization
	- Involves interrupting work on an activity to employ the resource on another activity , then returning the resource to finish the interrupted work.
	- Is feasible when startup and shutdown costs are low.
	- Is considered the major reason why projects fail to meet schedule.

### Benefits of Scheduling Resources
- Leaves time for consideration of reasonable alternatives
	- Cost-time tradeoffs
	- Changes in priorities

- Provides information for time-phased work package budgets to assess:
	- Impact of unforeseen events
	- Amount of flexibility in available resources

### Multiproject Scheduling Problems

1. Overall project slippage
	- Delay on one project create delays for other projects.

2. Inefficient resource application
	- The peaks and valleys of resource demands create scheduling problems and delays for projects.

3. Resource bottlenecks
	- Shortages of critical resources required for multiple projects cause delays and schedule extensions.

### Managing Multiproject Scheduling:
- Create project offices or departments to oversee the scheduling of resources across projects.
- Use a project priority queuing system: first come, first served for resources.
- Centralize project management: treat all projects as a part of a “megaproject.”
- Outsource projects to reduce the number of projects handled internally.

### Using the Resource Schedule to Develop a Project Cost Baseline

- Why a Time-Phased Budget Baseline Is Needed
	- To determine if the project is on, ahead, or behind schedule and over or under its budgeted costs?
	- To know how much work has been accomplished for the allocated money spent—the project cost baseline (planned value, PV)

- Creating a Time-Phased Budget
	- Assign each work package to one responsible person or department and deliverable.
	- Compare planned schedule and costs using an integrative system called earned value.
