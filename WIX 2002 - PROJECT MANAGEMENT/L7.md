# Resource

- Resource and Priorities
	- Project network times are not schedule until resources have been assigned 
		- The implicit assumption is that resource will be available in the required amounts when needed.
		- Adding new projects requires making realistic judgement of resource availability and project durations
	- Cost estimates are not a budge until the have been time-phased

## Resource Problem

1. Resource Smoothing ( or Leveling)
- Involves attempting to even out varying demands on resources by using slack (delaying noncritical activities) to manage resource utilization when resources are adequate over the life of the project .

2. Resource-Constrained Scheduling
- The duration of a project may be increased by delaying the late start of some of its activities if resources are not adequate to meet peak demands.

## Types of Project Constraints

- Technical or Logic Constraints
	- Constraints related to the networked sequence in which project activities must occur.
- Physical Constraints
	- Activities that cannot occur in parallel or are affected by contractual or environmental conditions.
- Resource Constraints
	- The absence, shortage, or unique interrelationship and interaction characteristics of resources that require a particular sequencing of project activities
- Kinds of Resource Constraints
	- People, materials, equipment


### Constraints Example

### Classification of Scheduling Problem

- Classification of Problem
	- Using a priority matrix will help determine if the project is time or resource constrained.
- Time-Constrained Project
	- Must be completed by an imposed date.
	- Time is fixed, resources are flexible: additional resources are required to ensure project meets schedule.
- Resource-Constrained Project
	- Is one in which the level of resources available cannot be exceeded.
		- Resources are fixed, time is flexible: inadequate resources will delay the project.

### Resource Allocation Method
1. Limiting Assumptions
	- Splitting activities is not allowed—once an activity is start, it is carried to completion.
	- Level of resources used for an activity cannot be changed.
2. Risk Assumptions
	- Activities with the most slack pose the least risk.
	- Reduction of flexibility does not increase risk.
	- The nature of an activity (easy, complex) doesn’t increase risk.
3. Time-Constrained Projects
	 - Must be completed by an imposed date. 
	- Require use of leveling techniques that focus on balancing or smoothing resource demands.
	- Use positive slack (delaying noncritical activities) to manage resource utilization over the duration of the project.
	- Peak resource demands are reduced.
	- Resources over the life of the project are reduced.
	- Fluctuation in resource demand is minimized.

### Resource Demand Leveling Techniques for Time-Constrained Projects

- Advantages : 
	- Peak resource demand are reduced
	- Resources over the life of project are reduced
	- Fluctuation in resource demand is minimized
- Disadvantages :
	- Loss of flexibility that occurs from reducing slack.
	- Increases in the criticality of all activities


### Resource-Constraint Projects

- Resources are limited in quantity or availability.
- Activities are scheduled using heuristics (rules-of-thumb) that focus on:
		1. Minimum slack
		2. Smallest (least) duration
		3. Lowest activity identification number
- The parallel method is used to apply heuristics
	- An iterative process starting at the first time period of the project and scheduling period-by-period the start of any activities using the three priority rules.

### The impacts of Resource-Constrained Scheduling
- Reduces delay but reduces flexibility


## Splitting
- Scheduling techniques for a creating a better project schedule and /or increase resource utilization
	- Involves interrupting work on an activity to employ the resource on another activity , then returning the resource to finish the interrupted work.
	- Is feasible when startup and shutdown costs are low.
	- Is considered the major reason why projects fail to meet schedule.

### Benefits of Scheduling Resources
- Leaves time for consideration of reasonable alternatives
	- Cost-time tradeoffs
	- Changes in priorities

- Provides information for time-phased work package budgets to assess:
	- Impact of unforeseen events
	- Amount of flexibility in available resources

### Multiproject Scheduling Problems

4. Overall project slippage
	- Delay on one project create delays for other projects.

5. Inefficient resource application
	- The peaks and valleys of resource demands create scheduling problems and delays for projects.

6. Resource bottlenecks
	- Shortages of critical resources required for multiple projects cause delays and schedule extensions.

### Managing Multiproject Scheduling:
- Create project offices or departments to oversee the scheduling of resources across projects.
- Use a project priority queuing system: first come, first served for resources.
- Centralize project management: treat all projects as a part of a “megaproject.”
- Outsource projects to reduce the number of projects handled internally.

### Using the Resource Schedule to Develop a Project Cost Baseline

- Why a Time-Phased Budget Baseline Is Needed
	- To determine if the project is on, ahead, or behind schedule and over or under its budgeted costs?
	- To know how much work has been accomplished for the allocated money spent—the project cost baseline (planned value, PV)

- Creating a Time-Phased Budget
	- Assign each work package to one responsible person or department and deliverable.
	- Compare planned schedule and costs using an integrative system called earned value.
