# Resource

- Resource and Priorities
	- Project network times are not schedule until resources have been assigned 
		- The implicit assumption is that resource will be available in the required amounts when needed.
		- Adding new projects requires making realistic judgement of resource availability and project durations
	- Cost estimates are not a budge until the have been time-phased

## Project Planning Process

## Resource Problem

1. Resource Smoothing ( or Leveling)
- Involves attempting to even out varying demands on resources by using slack (delaying noncritical activities) to manage resource utilization when resources are adequate over the life of the project .

2. Resource-Constrained Scheduling
- The duration ..

## Types of Project Constraints

1. Technical or Logic Constraint
- One activities depends on others
3. Physical Constraint
- Ex : 1 programmer has to handle many project
5. Resource Constraint


### Constraints Example

### Classification of Scheduling Problem

1. Classification of Problem
2. Time-Constrained Project
3. Resource-Constrained Project

### Resource Allocation Method
1. Limiting Assumptions
2. Risk Assumptions
- More slack , less risk
#### Time-Constrained Projects

Ex : Botanical Garden

#### Resource Demand Leveling Techniques for Time-Constrained Projects

- Advantages : 
	- Peak resource demand are reduced
	- Resources over the life of project are reduced
	- Fluctuation in resource demand is minimized
- Disadvantages :


### Resource-Constraint Projects

- Resources are limited in quantity or availability

Ex :

### Computer Demonstration of Resource-Constrained Scheduling

- EMR Project
	- The development of a handheld electronic medical reference guide to be used by emergency medical technicians and paramedic

### The impacts of Resource-Constrained Scheduling
- Reduces delay but reduces flexiblity


## Splitting
- Scheduling techniques for acreating a better project schedule and /or increase resource utililization
	- Involves interrupting work on an activity to employ the resouce on another activity

### Benefits of Scheduling Resources
- Leaves time for consideratio of reasonable alternatives


### Multiproject Resource Schedules
