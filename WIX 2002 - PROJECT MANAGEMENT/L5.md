### Practical Considerations
- Network Logic Errors
- Activity Numbering
- Use of Computers to Develop Networks
- Calendar Dates
- Multiple Starts and Multiple Projects

### Terms

- `Laddering` : Activities are broken into segments so the following activity can begin sooner and not delay the work.
- `Lags` :  The minimum amount of time a dependent activity must be delayed to begin or end.
	- Lengthy activities are broken down to reduce the delay in the start of successor activities.
	- Lags can be used to constrain finish-to-start, start-to-start, finish-to-finish, start-to-finish, or combination relationships.
