# Developing a Project Plan 2

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250124172926.png)

### Practical Considerations
- Network Logic Errors
- Activity Numbering
- Use of Computers to Develop Networks
- Calendar Dates
- Multiple Starts and Multiple Projects

### Terms

- `Laddering` : Activities are broken into segments so the following activity can begin sooner and not delay the work.
- `Lags` :  The minimum amount of time a dependent activity must be delayed to begin or end.
	- Lengthy activities are broken down to reduce the delay in the start of successor activities.
	- Lags can be used to constrain finish-to-start, start-to-start, finish-to-finish, start-to-finish, or combination relationships.

### Example of Laddering Using Finish-to-Start Relationship

### Hammock Activity
- Spans over a segment of a project.
- Has a duration that is determined after the network plan is drawn.
- Is used to aggregate sections of the project to facilitate getting the right amount of detail for specific sections of a project.
- Is very useful in assigning and controlling indirect project costs.
