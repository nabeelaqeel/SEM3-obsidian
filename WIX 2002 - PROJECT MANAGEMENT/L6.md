# Estimating Project Time and Cost

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250124211838.png)

Estimating
- The process of forecasting or approximating the time and cost of completing project deliverables.
- The task of balancing expectations of stakeholders and need for control while the project is implemented.

Types of Estimates
- Top-down (macro) estimates: analogy, group consensus, or mathematical relationships
- Bottom-up (micro) estimates: estimates of elements of the work breakdown structure

### Why Estimating Time and Cost Are Important
- To support good decisions.
- To schedule work.
- To determine how long the project should take and its cost.
- To determine whether the project is worth doing.
- To develop cash flow needs.
- To determine how well the project is progressing.
- To develop time-phased budgets and establish the project baseline.

### Factors Influencing the Quality of Estimates
- planning horizon
- Project duration
- People
- Project Structure and Organization
- Padding Estimate
- Organization Culture
- Other( Nonproject ) factor

### Preparing Initial Estimates
- Use people familiar with the tasks
- Use several people to make estimates
- Assume normal conditions
- Use consistent time units
- Assume task are independent
- Make no allowance for contingencies
- Include risk management

### Top-Down versus Bottom-Up Estimating

**Top-Down Estimates**
- Are usually derived from someone who uses experience and/or information to determine the project duration and total cost.
- Are made by top managers who have little knowledge of the processes used to complete the project.

**Bottom-Up Approach**
- Can serve as a check on cost elements in the WBS by rolling up the work packages and associated cost accounts to major deliverables at the work package level.

### Estimating Projects: Preferred Approach
- Make rough top-down estimates.
- Develop the WBS/OBS.
- Make bottom-up estimates.
- Develop schedules and budgets.
- Reconcile differences between top-down and bottom-up estimates

### Top-Down Approaches for Estimating Project Times and Costs
1. `Consensus methods` : agree with the suggestions
2. `Ratio methods` : this ratio relies on a fundamental project characteristic, such as size in square meters or the number of features in the software, and the cost per meter or feature to estimate the total project cost and duration
3. `Apportion method` : based on historical data - uses historical data of past projects that are relatively standard to allocate duration and costs to various segments of the current project.
4. `Function point methods` :  for software and system projects
5. `Learning curves` : a graphical representation of repetitive tasks that, when done on a continuous basis, lead to a reduction in activity duration, resources and costs.

### Consensus Method
- Uses the pooled experience of senior or middle managers to estimate the total project duration and cost.
- Meeting: experts discuss, argue and reach decision
- Can use Delphi method to be rigorous
- Only rough estimate
- Can be useful if experience and judgment have been accurate in the past.

### Bottom-Up Approaches for Estimating Project Times and Costs

- Template methods
	- The schedules and budget from past projects of similar starts but with different endings can be used as a starting point for the new project. Example: template for website development, for mobile apps with 5 features
- Parametric procedures applied to specific tasks
	- For example, as part of an MS Office conversion project, 36 different computer workstations needed to be converted .Based on past conversion projects, the project manager determined that on average one person could convert three workstations per day. Therefore the task of converting the 36 workstations would take three technicians four days.
- Range estimates for the WBS work packages 
	- when work packages have significant uncertainty associated with the time or cost to complete, it is a prudent policy to require three time estimates—low, average, and high
- Phase estimating: A hybrid :
	- uses a two-estimate system – a detailed (micro) estimate is made for the immediate stage and an overview (macro) estimate is made for the remaining stages. The accuracy of estimate is progressively being refined with fewer fluctuations of requirements as the project progresses

### Step to Estimate the Cost for an Agile Project

Estimating the cost for an Agile project requires a different approach than traditional. It is based on the features or user stories that are to be implemented during each iteration or sprint. Here are some steps to follow for estimating the cost of an Agile project:


- Step 1: 
	- Identify and prioritize the user stories for the project. User stories are short descriptions of the features or functionalities that the users want from the product. They are usually written from the user’s perspective and follow the format of “As a [role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]”. User stories should be clear, concise, testable, and valuable. They should also be prioritized based on their importance, urgency, and dependency. You can use techniques such as MoSCoW, Kano, or dot voting to prioritize the user stories1 .

- Step 2: 
	- Estimate the relative size or complexity of each user story using story points. Story points are units of measure that indicate how much effort, time, or risk is involved in completing a user story. They are not based on actual hours or days, but on a relative scale that compares the user stories to each other. You can use techniques such as planning poker, t-shirt sizes, or the bucket system to assign story points to the user stories1 . The total number of story points for all the user stories is the total scope of the project.

- Step 3: 
	- Estimate the team’s velocity for each sprint. Velocity is the average number of story points that the team can complete in one sprint. A sprint is a fixed time period, usually between one to four weeks, in which the team works on a subset of user stories. Velocity can be calculated by dividing the total number of story points completed by the team in the previous sprints by the number of sprints. If the team is new or has no historical data, you can use a baseline velocity based on the team size, availability, and productivity

- Step 4: 
	- Estimate the number of sprints required to complete the project. You can do this by dividing the total number of story points by the average velocity. This will give you the approximate number of sprints needed to deliver all the user stories. However, this is not a fixed number, as the scope, priority, and velocity of the project may change over time. You should also account for some buffer time for testing, integration, deployment, and feedback3 .

- Step 5: 
	- Estimate the cost per sprint and the total cost of the project. You can do this by multiplying the number of team members by their average hourly rate and by the number of hours per sprint. This will give you the cost per sprint. You can then multiply the cost per sprint by the number of sprints to get the total cost of the project. Alternatively, you can use the cost per story point method, which involves multiplying the average cost per story point by the total number of story points. The average cost per story point can be calculated by dividing the total cost of the previous projects by the total number of story points completed .

### Assumption and formula
- Velocity Formula
	- Dividing the total story points completed by the number of sprints in which they were completed.
	- For example: if the team has completed a total of 70 story points over a span of two sprints, the team’s velocity is 35 story points per sprint (70 points/ 2 sprints)

- Team capacity: 
	- number of development hours available in the sprint

- Story Points
	- It represent the effort required for development.
	- Each story point could represent a range of 4-12 hours.

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250201210513.png)
Velocity is a measure of a team’s capacity to get work done in a given sprint. It is expressed as a range, for example, 23 to 32 story points per sprint, especially early on in a project’s life

### Sprint Planning
- Scenario 1 :
	- To take a basic scenario, we take the total number of story points we got from sizing our backlog and divide that by our teams anticipated velocity. ( velocity is normally expressed as a range, but for simplicity, we’ll use a single number here.) We work in two week iterations so our velocity will be reflected by how much we can complete in a two week cycle with the available capacity of the team. If our story points totaled 120 and we anticipate completing 20 points per iteration, the total development duration would be 12 weeks or 6 iterations. We add to that a sprint 0 of 2 weeks and a release preparation sprint of two weeks. In total, our project length is 16 weeks

- Scenario 2 : 
	- Alternatively, if the project must be completed by a given date, in say 10 weeks, the team would determine how much of the backlog can be completed in that time. If we anticipate 20 story points per sprint, plus Sprint 0 and a release sprint, we would be targeting 100 points completed by the end of the project. Again, we would look to manage risk by adding an appropriate buffer, which might result in a target of 45 to 75 story points completed and ready to release

### Cost estimation
- 1 story point is about 4-12 hours
- 1 person-day is about 8 hours
- 238 days per person =1904 hours

### Estimation techniques
- Planning Poker and Wideband Delphi are both techniques used in Agile project management to estimate the effort required to complete a feature or user story. These techniques help teams arrive at a more accurate and reliable estimate of the effort required for each feature.

### Top-Down and Bottom-Up Estimates
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250202004635.png)

### Level of Detail
- Level of detail is different for different levels of management.
- Level of detail in the WBS varies with the complexity of the project.
- Excessive detail is costly. 
	- Fosters a focus on departmental outcomes
	- Creates unproductive paperwork
- Insufficient detail is costly. 
	- Lack of focus on goals
	- Wasted effort on nonessential activities

### Types of Costs
- Direct Costs
	- Costs that are clearly chargeable to a specific work package. 
		- Labor, materials, equipment, and other
- Direct (Project) Overhead Costs
	- Costs incurred that are directly tied to an identifiable project deliverable or work package. 
	- Salary, rents, supplies, specialized machinery
- General and Administrative Overhead Costs
	- Organization costs indirectly linked to a specific package that are apportioned to the project

### Contract Bid Summary Costs

### Refining Estimates
- Reasons for Adjusting Estimates
	- Interaction costs are hidden in estimates.
	- Normal conditions do not apply. 
	- Things go wrong on projects.
	- Changes in project scope and plans.
- Adjusting Estimates
	- Time and cost estimates of specific activities are adjusted as the risks, resources, and situation particulars become more clearly defined.
