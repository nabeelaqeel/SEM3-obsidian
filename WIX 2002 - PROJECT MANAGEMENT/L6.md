# Estimating Project Time and Cost

Estimating
- The process of forecasting or approximating the time and cost of completing project deliverables.
- The task of balancing expectations of stakeholders and need for control while the project is implemented.

Types of Estimates
- Top-down (macro) estimates: analogy, group consensus, or mathematical relationships
- Bottom-up (micro) estimates: estimates of elements of the work breakdown structure

### Why Estimating Time and Cost Are Important
- To support good decisions.
- To schedule work.
- To determine how long the project should take and its cost.
- To determine whether the project is worth doing.
- To develop cash flow needs.
- To determine how well the project is progressing.
- To develop time-phased budgets and establish the project baseline.

### Factors Influencing the Quality of Estimates
- planning horizon
- Project duration
- People
- Project Structure and Organization
- Padding Estimate
- Organization Culture
- Other( Nonproject ) factor

### Preparing Initial Estimates
- Use people familiar with the tasks
- Use several people to make estimates
- Assume normal conditions
- Use consistent time units
- Assume task are independent
- Make no allowance for contingencies
- Include risk management

### Top-Down versus Bottom-Up Estimating

**Top-Down Estimates**
- Are usually derived from someone who uses experience and/or information to determine the project duration and total cost.
- Are made by top managers who have little knowledge of the processes used to complete the project.

**Bottom-Up Approach**
- Can serve as a check on cost elements in the WBS by rolling up the work packages and associated cost accounts to major deliverables at the work package level.

### Estimating Projects: Preferred Approach
- Make rough top-down estimates.
- Develop the WBS/OBS.
- Make bottom-up estimates.
- Develop schedules and budgets.
- Reconcile differences between top-down and bottom-up estimates

### Top-Down Approaches for Estimating Project Times and Costs
1. `Consensus methods` : agree with the suggestions
2. `Ratio methods` : this ratio relies on a fundamental project characteristic, such as size in square meters or the number of features in the software, and the cost per meter or feature to estimate the total project cost and duration
3. `Apportion method` : based on historical data - uses historical data of past projects that are relatively standard to allocate duration and costs to various segments of the current project.
4. `Function point methods` :  for software and system projects
5. `Learning curves` : a graphical representation of repetitive tasks that, when done on a continuous basis, lead to a reduction in activity duration, resources and costs.

### Consensus Method
- Uses the pooled experience of senior or middle managers to estimate the total project duration and cost.
- Meeting: experts discuss, argue and reach decision
- Can use Delphi method to be rigorous
- Only rough estimate
- Can be useful if experience and judgment have been accurate in the past.
