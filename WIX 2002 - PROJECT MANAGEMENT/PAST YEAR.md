To determine the correct leadership style, let’s analyze the question in the context of **Lewin’s leadership styles** and the initial phase of creating awareness and understanding during organizational change.

---

### **Key Concept: Lewin’s Leadership Styles**

Kurt Lewin identified three primary leadership styles:

1. **Autocratic Leadership:**
    
    - The leader makes decisions unilaterally and demands strict compliance.
    - Suitable for situations requiring quick decisions but may hinder team awareness and understanding.
2. **Democratic Leadership:**
    
    - Involves collaboration, participation, and team input in decision-making.
    - Promotes awareness, understanding, and ownership among team members.
    - Effective for creating a sense of responsibility and mutual understanding during change.
3. **Laissez-Faire Leadership:**
    
    - Minimal intervention from the leader, leaving decisions to the team.
    - Ineffective during the initial phase of change, as it lacks direction and structure.
4. **Transformational Leadership:**
    
    - Focuses on inspiring and motivating team members to embrace change.
    - Suitable for driving long-term commitment but less effective in establishing awareness and understanding in the **initial phase**.

---

### **Analysis of Options:**

1. **A. Kepimpinan Autokratik (Autocratic Leadership):**
    
    - **Not Ideal:** While it may enforce compliance, it doesn’t foster understanding or awareness among the team.
2. **B. Kepimpinan Demokratik (Democratic Leadership):**
    
    - **Correct:** Democratic leadership is the best approach for the initial phase of organizational change. It encourages collaboration, team input, and shared understanding, which are essential for building awareness and buy-in.
3. **C. Kepimpinan Laissez-Faire (Laissez-Faire Leadership):**
    
    - **Not Ideal:** Laissez-Faire leadership lacks the structure and guidance needed during the critical initial phase of change.
4. **D. Kepimpinan Transformasi (Transformational Leadership):**
    
    - **Somewhat Relevant:** While transformational leadership is effective for inspiring long-term commitment, it is less suited for the initial phase, which requires more participative collaboration.

---

### **Answer:**

**B. Kepimpinan Demokratik (Democratic Leadership)**

This style is the most effective for creating awareness and understanding during the early stages of organizational change.

To determine the correct answer, let’s analyze the levels of management and their roles.

---

### **Key Concept: Levels of Management**

1. **Top-Level Management:**
    
    - Responsible for strategic decisions and long-term planning.
    - Decisions include adopting new methodologies, company direction, and overall organizational goals.
2. **Middle-Level Management:**
    
    - Responsible for implementing strategies set by top-level management.
    - Bridges top-level and frontline management by delegating and ensuring strategies are executed.
3. **Frontline Management:**
    
    - Supervises day-to-day operations.
    - Focuses on specific tasks and immediate operational concerns.
4. **Operational Management:**
    
    - Overlaps with frontline management but focuses on ensuring processes are efficient and meet organizational standards.

---

### **Analysis of the Question:**

- The decision to adopt a **new project management methodology** is a **strategic decision** that affects the organization’s direction.
- Such decisions fall under the responsibilities of **top-level management**, as they align with strategic planning and organizational goals.

---

### **Answer:**

**A. Pengurusan peringkat tertinggi (Top-level management)**

Top-level management is responsible for strategic decisions, including whether to adopt new project management methodologies.

To determine the correct answer, let's understand the scenarios where transforming a **project** into a **program** is advisable during the planning phase.

---

### **Key Concept: Project vs. Program**

1. **Project**: A single, temporary endeavor focused on specific deliverables and objectives.
2. **Program**: A collection of related projects managed in a coordinated manner to achieve strategic goals.

Transforming a project into a program is recommended when:

- Multiple interconnected projects contribute to a larger, strategic objective.
- The coordination of related projects can achieve greater benefits.

---

### **Options Analysis:**

1. **A. Apabila menghadapi kekangan kewangan yang ketat (When facing tight budget constraints):**
    
    - **Incorrect**: Budget constraints are more about resource optimization within a project, not a reason to transform it into a program.
2. **B. Apabila matlamat projek saling berkaitan dan strategik (When project goals are interconnected and strategic):**
    
    - **Correct**: This is the primary reason to recommend transforming a project into a program. Programs help manage multiple interconnected projects to achieve strategic objectives effectively.
3. **C. Apabila mencari penyelesaian tugas individu dengan cepat (When seeking rapid completion of individual tasks):**
    
    - **Incorrect**: This suggests focusing on task-level execution, which is handled within a single project, not through a program.
4. **D. Apabila projek memerlukan penyelarasan yang minimum (When projects require minimal coordination):**
    
    - **Incorrect**: Programs are specifically meant to handle projects requiring **greater coordination**, not minimal.

---

### **Answer:**

**B. Apabila matlamat projek saling berkaitan dan strategik (When project goals are interconnected and strategic).**

This is the most appropriate scenario for transforming a project into a program.

Let’s analyze the question carefully to identify the best answer.

---

### **Key Concept: Effective Communication in Conflict Resolution**

A project manager needs to manage conflicts effectively by balancing open communication and respecting differing opinions and perspectives. This involves:

1. Encouraging collaboration and dialogue.
2. Respecting diverse viewpoints.
3. Avoiding extremes, such as over-limiting communication or discouraging perspectives.

---

### **Options Analysis:**

4. **A. Menggalakkan dialog terbuka; Hadkan komunikasi kepada butiran penting.**
    
    - Translation: "Encourage open dialogue; Limit communication to essential details."
    - **Incorrect**: While encouraging dialogue is good, limiting communication to only essential details could stifle the open exchange of ideas necessary for resolving conflicts.
5. **B. Memupuk persekitaran kolaboratif; Tidak menggalakkan perspektif yang pelbagai.**
    
    - Translation: "Foster a collaborative environment; Discourage diverse perspectives."
    - **Incorrect**: Discouraging diverse perspectives contradicts the goal of addressing conflicting opinions constructively.
6. **C. Meminimumkan komunikasi untuk mengelakkan konflik; Utamakan pendapat individu.**
    
    - Translation: "Minimize communication to avoid conflicts; Prioritize individual opinions."
    - **Incorrect**: Minimizing communication and prioritizing individual opinions could lead to unresolved conflicts and lack of team cohesion.
7. **D. Mengimbangi komunikasi terbuka dengan menghormati pelbagai sudut pandangan.**
    
    - Translation: "Balance open communication with respect for diverse viewpoints."
    - **Correct**: This approach directly addresses the need to balance open dialogue while respecting differing opinions, fostering a productive and inclusive environment.

---

### **Answer:**

**D. Mengimbangi komunikasi terbuka dengan menghormati pelbagai sudut pandangan.**

This approach ensures effective communication and conflict resolution within project teams.
