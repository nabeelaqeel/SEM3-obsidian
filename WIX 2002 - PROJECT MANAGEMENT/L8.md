## Rationale for Reducing Project Duration

- Time is Money : Cost-Time 
	- Reducing the time of a critical activity usually incurs additional direct costs
		- Cost-time solutions focus on `reducing (crashing)` activities on the` critical path` to `shorten` overall duration of the project
	- Reason for imposed project duration dates : 
		- Time-to-market pressures
		- Unforeseen delays
		- Inceptive contracts(bonuses for early completion)
		- Imposed deadlines and contract commitments
		- Overhead and public goodwill costs
		- Pressure to move resources to other projects
### Options for Accelerating Project Completion
- Resource Not Constrained
	- Adding resources
	- Outsourcing project work
	- scheduling overtime
	- establishing a core project team
	- Do it twice - fast and then correctly
- Resources Constrained
	- Fast-tracking ( parallel )
	- Critical-chain
	- Reducing project scope
	- Compromise quality

### Explanation of Project Costs

- Project Indirect Costs
	- Costs that cannot be associated with any particular work package or project activity 
		- Supervision, administration , consultants , and interest
	- Cost that vary (increase ) with time
		- Reducing project time directly reduces indirect costs
- Project Direct Cost
	- Normal costs that can be assigned directly to a specific work package or project activity
		- Labor , materials , equipment , and subcontractors
	- Crashing activities increase direct costs

### Reducing Project Duration to Reduce Project Cost

- Identifying direct costs to reduce project time
	- Gather information about direct and indirect costs of specific project durations
	- Search critical activities for lowest direct-cost activities to shorten project duration
	- Compute total costs for specific durations and compare to benefits of reducing project time

### Project Cost-Duration Graph

 - If we gonna reduce from 14 to 13 
	 - Indirect cost decrease, direct cost increase
### Constructing a Project Cost-Duration Graph

- Shorten the activities with smallest increase in cost per unit of time
- Assumption : 
	- The cost relationship is linear
	- Normal time assumes low-cost , efficient methods to complete the activity
	- Crash time represents a limit - the greatest time reduction possible under realistic conditions
	- Slope represents a constant cost per unit of time
	- All accelerations must occur within the normal and crash times

### Activity Graph
![[Pasted image 20241211114832.png]]
- `Crashing` : Shortening an activity
- `Crash point` : The maximum time an activity can be compress
- `slope` : the steeper slope = cost more to shorten one time unit
### Cost - Duration Trade -off  ex
![[Pasted image 20241211114904.png]]
A : 3 - 2 : 70 - 50  , 1 : 20
- `crash time` : the shortest possible time an activity can realistically be completed
- `Crash cost` : the direct cost for completing an activity in crash time
- `slope = 0` : activity cannot be reduced further
$$Cost Slope = \frac{rise}{run} = \frac{Crash Cost - Normal Cost}{Normal Time - Crash Time}$$

##### Project Network Diagram

- `X` : indicate that impossible to shorten activity G
- 1st choose critical path : ADFG

- 2 CRITICAL PATH : ACFG , ADFG
- Since C,D is parallel activity : if we reduce C we have to reduce D also
- Time 22 : ALL PATH ARE CIRITICAL PATH
- So have to reduce parallel activity : CDE  
> WHY ? weird why not just reduce b first
> maybe because we have to reduce all path

### Constructing a Project Cost - Duration Graph
1. Find total direct costs for selected project durations
2. Find total indirect costs for selected project durations
3. Sum direct and indirect costs for these selected project durations

Compare additional cost alternatives for benefits

- optimum cost-time : 22 time : 775$
### Practical Considerations
- Using the Project Cost-Duration Times
- Crash Times
- Linearity Assumption
- Choice of Activities to Crash Revisited
- Time Reduction Decisions and Sensitivity

### What if cost , Not time is the issue
- Commonly Used Option for Cutting Cost
	- Reducing project scope
	- Having owner take on more responsibility
	- Outsourcing project activities or even the entire project
	- Brainstorming cost savings options

### Key terms
- Crashing
- Crash point 
- Crash time
- Direct costs
- Fast-tracking
- Indirect costs
- Outsourcing
