### Risk Management Process

- Risk
	- Uncertain or chance events that planning can not overcome or control.

- Negative Risk
	- Staff turnover, lack of technical skills, scope creep, cost 
	
- Positive Risk-too much of a good thing
	- Overwhelmed of products sign-up lead to heavy access ofwebsite and affects of server crash
	- Reduction of material costs
	- New product launched is too successful and get more demand from expected. Yet, the demand exceed firm capability to produce the products.


### Risk Management
- A proactive attempt to recognize and manage internal events and external threats that affect the likelihood of a project’s success.
	- What can go wrong (risk event).
	- How to minimize the risk event’s impact (consequences).
	- What can be done before an event occurs (anticipation).
	- What to do when an event occurs (contingency plans).

### The Risk Event Graph
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250201224252.png)
As the project reaches its later stages, risk declines as uncertainties are resolved. However, the consequences of a risk event increase in cost over the life of the project as it becomes more difficult to alter fully developed project features


### Risk Management’s Benefits
- A proactive rather than reactive approach.
- Reduces surprises and negative consequences.
- Prepares the project manager to take advantage of appropriate risks-Positive risk
- Provides better control over the future.
- Improves chances of reaching project performance objectives within budget and on time

### Managing Risk
- Step 1: Risk Identification
	- Generate a list of possible risks through brainstorming, problem identification and risk profiling.
		- Macro risks first, then specific events

- Step 2: Risk Assessment
	- Scenario analysis for event probability and impact
	- Risk assessment matrix
	- Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
	- Probability analysis
		- Decision trees, NPV, and PERT
	- Semi quantitative scenario analysis
- Step 3: Risk Response Development
	- Mitigating Risk
		- Reducing the likelihood an adverse event will occur.
		- Reducing impact of adverse event.
	- Avoiding Risk
		- Changing the project plan to eliminate the risk or condition.
	- Transferring Risk
		- Paying a premium to pass the risk to another party – Security Testing
		- Requiring Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) provisions _ Highway
	- Retaining Risk
		- Making a conscious decision to accept the risk.
- Step 4: Risk Response Control
	- Risk control
		- Execution of the risk response strategy
		- Monitoring of triggering events
		- Initiating contingency plans
		- Watching for new risks
	- Establishing a Change Management System
		- Monitoring, tracking, and reporting risk
		- Fostering an open organization environment
		- Repeating risk identification/assessment exercises
		- Assigning and documenting responsibility for managing risk

## Risk Identification

## Risk Assessment

### Defined Conditions for Impact Scales of a Risk on Major Project Objectives (Examples for negative impacts only)

### Risk Assessment Form
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250201224635.png)
Figure above is a partial example of a risk assessment form used on an IS project involving the upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8. In addition to evaluating the severity and probability of risk events, the form assesses when the event might occur and its detection difficulty. Detection difficulty is a measure of how easy it would be to detect that the event was going to occur in time to take mitigating action, that is, how much warning would the project manager have? In example, the detection scale would range from 5 (no warning) to 1 (lots of time to react).


### Activities – Risk Assessment

### Risk Severity Matrix
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
Impact × Probability × Detection = Risk Value
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250201224815.png)
- Red zone (major risk)
- Yellow zone (moderate risk)
- Green zone (minor risk)

Impact=5, occurrence = 2
vs
Occurrence=5, impact=2

### Contingency Planning
- Contingency Plan
	- An alternative plan that will be used if a possible foreseen risk event actually occurs.
	- A plan of actions that will reduce or mitigate the negative impact (consequences) of a risk event.
- Risks of Not Having a Contingency Plan
	- Having no plan may slow managerial response.
	- Decisions made under pressure can be potentially dangerous and costly

### Risk and Contingency Planning
- Technical Risks
	- Backup strategies if chosen technology fails.
	- Assessing whether technical uncertainties can be resolved.

- Schedule Risks
	- Use of slack increases the risk of a late project finish-compress.
	- Imposed duration dates (absolute project finish date)
	- Compression of project schedules due to a shortened project duration date.
- Costs Risks
	- Time/cost dependency links: costs increase when problems take longer to solve than expected.
	- Price protection risks (a rise in input costs) increase if the duration of a project is increased.
- Funding Risks
	- What if the funding for the project is cut by 25 percent or completion projections indicate that costs will greatly exceed available funds?
	- Changes in the supply of funds for the project can dramatically affect the likelihood of implementation or successful completion of a project.

### Risk Response Matrix
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250201225300.png)
- The first step is to identify whether to reduce, share, transfer, or accept the risk.
- The team decided to reduce the chances of the system freezing by experimenting with a prototype of the system.
- The risk of equipment malfunctioning is transferred by choosing a reliable supplier with a strong warranty program.

### Opportunity Management Tactics
- Project managers can use several tactics to exploit an opportunity (take advantage of a positive risk by:
	- Exploit
		- Seeking to eliminate the uncertainty associated with an opportunity to ensure that it definitely happens.
		- Examples revising a design to enable a component to be purchased rather than developed internally.
	- Share
		- Allocating some or all of the ownership of an opportunity to another party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project.
		- Examples include establishing continuous improvement incentives for external contractors or joint ventures.
	- Enhance
		- Taking action to increase the probability and/or the positive impact of an opportunity.
		- Example : choosing raw materials that are likely to decline in price.

	- Accept
		- Being willing to take advantage of an opportunity if it occurs, but not taking action to pursue it.

### Contingency Funding and Time Buffers
- Contingency Funds
	- Funds to cover project risks—identified and unknown.
		- Size of funds reflects overall risk of a project
	- Budget reserves
		- Are linked to the identified risks of specific work packages.
	- Management reserves
		- Are large funds to be used to cover major unforeseen risks (e.g., change in project scope) of the total project.

- Time Buffers
	- Amounts of time used to compensate for unplanned delays in the project schedule.
		- Severe risk, merge, noncritical, and scarce resource activities

## Risk response control

### Change Management Control
- Sources of Change
	- Project scope changes
	- Implementation of contingency plans
	- Improvement changes

### Change Control System Process
1. Identify proposed changes.
2. List expected effects of proposed changes on schedule and budget.
3. Review, evaluate, and approve or disapprove of changes formally.
4. Negotiate and resolve conflicts of change, condition, and cost.
5. Communicate changes to parties affected.
6. Assign responsibility for implementing change.
7. Adjust master schedule and budget.
8. Track all changes that are to be implemented

### The Change Control Process
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250201230001.png)

### Benefits of a Change Control System
1. Inconsequential changes are discouraged by the formal process.
2. Costs of changes are maintained in a log.
3. Integrity of the WBS and performance measures is maintained.
4. Allocation and use of budget and management reserve funds are tracked.
5. Responsibility for implementation is clarified.
6. Effect of changes is visible to all parties involved.
7. Implementation of change is monitored.
8. Scope changes will be quickly reflected in baseline and performance measures
