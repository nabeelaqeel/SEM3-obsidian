### Changes in the organization’s mission and strategy
- Project managers must respond to changes with appropriate decisions about future projects and adjustments to current projects.
- Project managers who understand their organization’s strategy can become effective advocates of projects aligned with the firm’s mission.

### Mistakes caused by not understanding the role of projects in accomplishing strategy:
- Focusing on problems or solutions with low strategic priority.
- Focusing on the immediate customer rather than the whole market place and value chain.
- Overemphasizing technology that results in projects that pursue exotic technology that does not fit the strategy or customer need
- Trying to solve customer issues with a product or service rather than focusing on the 20% with 80% of the value (Pareto’s Law).
- Engaging in a never-ending search for perfection only the project team really cares about.

### Strategic Management
 - Requires every project to be clearly linked to strategy.
- Provides theme and focus of firm’s future direction.
	- Responding to changes in the external environment—environmental scanning
	- Allocating scarce resources of the firm to improve its competitive position—internal responses to new programs
- Requires strong links among mission, goals, objectives, strategy, and implementation.

### Four Activities of the Strategic Management Process
- Review and define the organizational mission.
- Set long-range goals and objectives.
- Analyze and formulate strategies to reach objectives.
- Implement strategies through projects

### Characteristic Objective

`S` : Specific        
`M` : Measurable
`A` : Assignable
`R` : Realistic
`T` : Time related

### The Need for a Strong Project Priority System
The Implementation Gap
- The lack of understanding and consensus on strategy among top management and middle-level (functional) managers who independently implement the strategy.

Organization Politics
- Project selection is based on the persuasiveness and power of people advocating the projects.

Resource Conflicts and Multitasking
- Multiproject environment creates interdependency relationships of shared resources which results in the starting, stopping, and restarting projects.

### Benefits of Project Portfolio Management
- Builds discipline into the project selection process.
- Links project selection to strategic metrics.
- Prioritizes project proposals across a common set of criteria, rather than on politics or emotion.
- Allocates resources to projects that align with strategic direction.
- Balances risk across all projects.
- Justifies killing projects that do not support strategy.
- Improves communication and supports agreement on project goals.

### Design of a project portfolio system:
- Classification of a project
- Selection criteria depending upon classification
- Sources of proposals
- Evaluating proposals
- Managing the portfolio of projects.

### Portfolio of Projects by Type
