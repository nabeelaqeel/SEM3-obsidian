# Organization Strategy

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250124171754.png)

### Changes in the organization’s mission and strategy
- Project managers must respond to changes with appropriate `decisions` about future projects and `adjustments` to current projects.
- Project managers who understand their organization’s strategy can become effective advocates of projects aligned with the firm’s mission.

### Mistakes caused by not understanding the role of projects in accomplishing strategy:
- Focusing on problems or solutions with low strategic `priority`.
- Focusing on the `immediate` customer rather than the whole market place and value chain.
- Overemphasizing `technology` that results in projects that pursue exotic technology that does not fit the strategy or customer need
- Trying to solve customer `issues` with a product or service rather than focusing on the 20% with 80% of the value (Pareto’s Law).
- Engaging in a never-ending search for `perfection` only the project team really cares about.

### Strategic Management
 - Requires every project to be clearly linked to strategy.
- Provides theme and focus of firm’s future direction.
	- Responding to changes in the external environment—environmental scanning
	- Allocating scarce resources of the firm to improve its competitive position—internal responses to new programs
- Requires strong links among mission, goals, objectives, strategy, and implementation.

### Four Activities of the Strategic Management Process
- Review and define the organizational `mission`.
- Set long-range `goals` and objectives.
- Analyze and formulate `strategies` to reach objectives.
- Implement strategies through projects

### Characteristic Objective

`S` : Specific        
`M` : Measurable
`A` : Assignable
`R` : Realistic
`T` : Time related

### The Need for a Strong Project Priority System
- The Implementation Gap
	- The lack of understanding and consensus on strategy among top management and middle-level (functional) managers who independently implement the strategy.
- Organization Politics
	- Project selection is based on the persuasiveness and power of people advocating the projects.
- Resource Conflicts and Multitasking
	- Multiproject environment creates interdependency relationships of shared resources which results in the starting, stopping, and restarting projects.

### Benefits of Project Portfolio Management
- Builds discipline into the project selection process.
- Links project selection to strategic metrics.
- Prioritizes project proposals across a common set of criteria, rather than on politics or emotion.
- Allocates resources to projects that align with strategic direction.
- Balances risk across all projects.
- Justifies killing projects that do not support strategy.
- Improves communication and supports agreement on project goals.

### Design of a project portfolio system:
- Classification of a project
- Selection criteria depending upon classification
- Sources of proposals
- Evaluating proposals
- Managing the portfolio of projects.


### Portfolio of Projects by Type
![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250124172755.png)

### A Portfolio Management System

- Selection Criteria
	- `Financial models`: payback, net present value (NPV)
	- `Non-financial models`: projects of strategic importance to the firm.
- Multi-Weighted Scoring Models
	- Use several weighted selection criteria to evaluate project proposals.

### Financial Models
- The Payback Model
	- Measures the time the project will take to recover the project investment.
	- Uses more desirable shorter paybacks.
	- Emphasizes cash flows, a key factor in business.

- Limitations of Payback:
	- Ignores the time value of money.
	- Assumes cash inflows for the investment period (and not beyond).
	- Does not consider profitability.
- The Net Present Value (NPV) model
	- Uses management’s minimum desired rate-of-return (discount rate) to compute the present value of all net cash inflows.
		- Positive NPV: project meets minimum desired rate of return and is eligible for further consideration.
		- Negative NPV: project is rejected.
- $$
Project NPV = I_0 + \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{F_t}{(1 + k)^t}
$$
	$I_0$ = Initial Investment (since it is an outflow , the number will be negative)
	$F_t$ = net cash inflow for period $t$
	$k$  = required rate of return

### Nonfinancial Strategic Criteria
- To capture larger market share
- To make it difficult for competitors to enter the market
- To develop an enabler product, which by its introduction will increase sales in more profitable products
- To develop core technology that will be used in next-generation products
- To reduce dependency on unreliable suppliers
- To prevent government intervention and regulation
- To restore corporate image or enhance brand recognition
- To demonstrate its commitment to corporate citizenship and support for community development.
### Multi-Criteria Selection Models
- Checklist Model
	- Uses a list of questions to review potential projects and to determine their acceptance or rejection.
	- Fails to answer the relative importance or value of a potential project and doesn’t to allow for comparison with other potential projects.
- Multi-Weighted Scoring Model
	- Uses several weighted qualitative and/or quantitative selection criteria to evaluate project proposals.
	- Allows for comparison of projects with other potential projects

### Sample Selection Questions Used in Practice

| Topic                | Question                                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Organization culture | Is our organization culture right for this type of project? |
| Resources            | Will internal resources be available for this project?      |
| Approach             | Will we build or buy?                                       |
| Schedule             | How long will this project take?                            |
| Schedule             | Is the time line realistic?                                 |
| Training/resources   | Will staff training be required?                            |
| Finance/portfolio    | What is the estimated cost of the project?                  |
| Portfolio            | Is this a new initiative or part of an existing initiative? |
| Portfolio            | How does this project interact with current projects?       |
| Technology           | Is the technology available or new?                         |
 
### Project Screening Matrix

### Applying a Selection Model
- Project Classification
	- Deciding how well a strategic or operations project fits the organization’s strategy.
- Selecting a Model
	- Applying a weighted scoring model to align projects closer with the organization’s strategic goals.
		- Reduces the number of wasteful projects
		- Helps identify proper goals for projects
		- Helps everyone involved understand how and why a project is selected

### Project Proposals
- Sources and Solicitation of Project Proposals
	- Within the organization
	- Request for proposal (RFP) from external sources (contractors and vendors)
- Ranking Proposals and Selection of Projects
	- Prioritizing requires discipline, accountability, responsibility, constraints, reduced flexibility , and loss of power.
- Managing the Portfolio
	- Senior management input
	- The priority team (project office) responsibilities
