## Terms

- `project` : A complex, nonroutine, one-time effort limited by time, budget, resources, and performance specifications designed to meet customer needs.
- `program` : A series of coordinated, related, multiple projects that continue over an extended time and are intended to achieve a goal.
- `program` : A higher level group of projects targeted at a common goal.

### Major Characteristics of a Project
- Has an established objective. (give some examples of objective)
- Has a defined life span with a beginning and an end.
- Requires across-the-organizational participation.

### The Challenge of Project Management

The Project Manager
- Manages temporary, non-repetitive activities and frequently acts independently of the formal organization.
	- Marshals resources for the project.
	- Is linked directly to the customer interface.
	- Provides direction, coordination, and integration to the project team.
	- Is responsible for performance and success of the project.
- Must induce the right people at the right time to address the right issues and make the right decisions.

### Factors leading to the increased use of project management:
- Compression of the product life cycle
- Knowledge explosion
- Triple bottom line (planet, people, profit)
- Corporate downsizing
- Increased customer focus
- Small projects represent big problems

### Integration (or centralization) of project management provides senior management with:
- An overview of all project management activities
- A big picture of how organizational resources are used
- A risk assessment of their portfolio of projects
- A rough metric of the firm’s improvement in managing projects relative to others in the industry
- Linkages of senior management with actual project execution management

### Problems resulting from the uncoordinated project management systems include:
- Projects that do not support the organization’s overall strategic plan and goals.
- Independent managerial decisions that create internal imbalances, conflicts and confusion resulting in dissatisfied customers.
- Failure to prioritize projects results in the waste of resources on non-value-added activities/projects
