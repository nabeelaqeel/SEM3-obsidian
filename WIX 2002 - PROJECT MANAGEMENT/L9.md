### Structure of a Project Monitoring Information System
- Creating a project monitoring system involves determining :
	- What data to collect - which metric used for project control
	- How , when , and who will collect the data
	- How to analyze the data
	- How to report current progress to management


- Information System Structure 
	- What data are collected?
		- Current status of project (schedule and cost)
		- Remaining cost to complete project
		- Date that project will be complete
		- Potential problems to be addressed now
		- Out-of-control activities requiring intervention
		- Cost and/or schedule overruns and the reasons for them
		- Forecast of overruns at a time of project completion
	- Collecting data and analysis
		- Who will collect project data? (project team /contractor / independent cost engineer / project manager ?)
		- How will data be collected ? (electronically)
		- When will the data be collected ? (reporting period - one hour / one week)
		- Who will compile and analyze the data ? (who in charge of the data ? )
	- Report and reporting
		- Who will receive the reports?
		- How will the reports be transmitted?
		- When will the reports be distributed?

> NOTE : 
> Which metrics will be use for 
> 1. project control , and 
> 2. compared against planned times , resource and budget

## Project Progress Report Format

- Progress since last report
- Current status of project
	1. Schedule
	2. Cost
	3. Scope
- Cumulative trends
- Problems and issues since last report
	1. Actions and resolution of earlier problems
	2. New variances and problem identified
- Corrective action planned


## The Project Control Process

- Control
	- The process of comparing actual performance against plan to identify deviations , evaluate courses of action ,and take appropriate corrective action
- Project Control Steps
	1. Setting a baseline plan 
	2. Measuring progress and performance 
	3. Comparing plan against actual 
	4. Taking action

- Tools 
	- Tracking and baseline Gantt chart
	- Control charts

### Baseline and Tracking Gantt Chart

![[Pasted image 20241211184740.png]]
- The solid bar : 
	- The actual start and finish times for completed activities
	- Or any portion of an activity completed 
	- See activity A,B,C,D,E

### Development of an Earned Value Cost / Schedule System

- Time-Phase Baseline Plan
	- Correct the failure of most monitoring systems to connect a project's actual performance to tis schedule and forecast budget 
		- System that measure only cost variances do not identify resource and project cost problems associated with falling behind or progressing ahead of schedule
- Earned Value Cost / Schedule System
	- An integrated project management system based on the earned value concept that uses a time- phased budget baseline to compare actual and planned schedule and costs

| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EV   | Earned value for a task is simply the percent complete times its original budget. Stated differently,<br><br>EV is the percent of the original budget that has been earned by actual work completed.             |
| PV   | The planned time-phased baseline of the value of the work scheduled. An approved cost estimate<br><br>of the resources scheduled in a time-phased cumulative baseline <BCWS—budgeted cost of the work scheduled> |
| AC   | Actual cost of the work completed. The sum of the costs incurred in accomplishing work.<br><br><ACWP—actual cost of the work performed.>                                                                         |
| CV   | Cost variance is the difference between the earned value and the actual costs for the work<br><br>completed to date where CV = EV – AC                                                                           |

### Developing an Integrated Cost / Schedule System

1. Define the work using a `WBS`
	- Scope
	- Work packages 
	- Deliverable
	- Organizational units
	- Resources
	- Budget
2. Develop `work` and `resource schedule`
	- Schedule resources to activities
	- time-phase work packages into a network 
3. Develop a time-phased budget using work packages included in an activity. `Accumulate budget (PV)`
4. At the work package level , collect the `actual costs` for the work performed `(AC)` . Multiply percent complete times original budget (EV) . 
5. Compute the `schedule variance (EV - PV)` and the c`ost variance (EV  - AC)`

### Project Management Information System Overview
![[Pasted image 20241211235312.png]]

- `Control data` can be` traced backward `to specific backward to specific deliverables and organization unit responsible . 

### Development of Project Baselines

- Purposes of a Baseline (PV)
	- An anchor point for measuring performance
		- A planned cost and expected schedule against which actual cost and schedule are measured
		- A basis for cash flows and awarding progress payments
		- A summation of time-phased budget( cost accounts as summed work packages ) along a project timeline
#### What cost are included in a Baseline?
- Labor , equipment , material , project direct overhead cost (DOC)

#### Rules for Placing Costs in Baselines
- Cost are placed exactly as they are expected to be "earned" in order to track them to their point of origin
- Percent Complete Rule
	- Cost are periodically asssigned to a baseline as units of work are completed over the duraiton of a work package

- Establish frequent checkpoint over the duration of the work package
- Assign completion percentages in dollar terms
