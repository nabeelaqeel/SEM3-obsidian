# Continuous

## Continuous Random Variables
- take any value within a range of values
## Continuous Probability Distribution
- The probability distribution of continuous random variable is represented by an equation , called the probability density function ( pdf )

	$$P(c \leq x \leq d) = \int_{c}^{d} f(x)\,dx $$
	$$Expected \,value, E(X) = \int_{a}^{b} x f(x) \, dx$$

- All probability density functions satisfy the following conditions :
	- The random variable Y is a function of X ; that is , y = f(x)
	- The value of y is greater than or equal to zero for all values of x
	- The total area under the curve of the function = 1

$$P(x=a) = 0$$

### Properties of continuous random variable
- Property 1 : $$P(a < W \leq b ) = F_w(b) - F_w(a)$$
- **Property 2**:
$$
\begin{align*}
P(a < W \leq b) & = P(a \leq W \leq b) \\
                & = P(a \leq W < b) \\
                & = P(a < W < b) \\
                & = \int_a^b f_W(x) \, dx
\end{align*}

$$
- Property 3 : $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_w(x)\,dx = 1$$

## Uniform Distribution

$$ X \sim U(a,b)$$

$$pdf : \frac{1}{b-a}$$
$$cdf : \frac{x-a}{b-a}$$

- a = lowest value of x
- b = highest value of x

### Example 
- A deck of cards has within it uniform distributions because the likelihood of drawing a heart, a club, a diamond, or a spade is equally likely.

- A coin also has a uniform distribution because the probability of getting either heads or tails in a coin toss is the same.

## Normal distribution
$$N(\mu ,\sigma^2)$$
$$pdf :f(x) =  \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-2)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
$$P(X < x) = P(Z < \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma})$$

CDF : F(x) = use tables or Software

### Properties of Normal Distribution
- The mean , median and mode are exactly the same
- The distribution is symmetric about the mean
- The distribution can be described by 2 values :
	- the mean 
	- standard deviation
- Empirical rule
	- 68%
	- 95%
	- 99.7%

### Difference between Normal D. and Uniform D
- The normal distribution is` bell-shaped,` which means value near the center of the distribution are more likely to occur as opposed to values on the tails of the distribution.

- The uniform distribution is `rectangular-shaped`, which means every value in the distribution is equally likely to occur

## Exponential Distribution
$$exp(\lambda)$$
$$pdf : \lambda e ^ {- \lambda x}$$
$$cdf : 1 - e ^ {-\lambda x}$$

- The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that often concerns the amount of time until some specific event happens. It is a process in which events happen continuously and independently t a constant average rate

- Memoryless
	- the probability of waiting time is not affected having waiting a certain time without incident.
- Example : 
	- Waiting taxi. The probability for you to get a taxi did not increase because of you have waited for quite some time (in contrast to train service)
## Other probability distribution
- Beta distribution
- Gamma distribution
