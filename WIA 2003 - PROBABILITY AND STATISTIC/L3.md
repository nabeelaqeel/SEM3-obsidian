# Discrete Random Variable and Discrete Probability Distribution

## Discrete Random Variable
- Discrete random variables take on integer values, usually the result of counting.


### Probability Distribution
- A probability distribution is a table or an equation that links each possible value that a random variable can assume with its probability of occurrence.

### Random Variable Attributes

$$E(X) = \mu_x = \sum[x_i \times P(x_i)]$$
$$\sigma^2 = \sum{[x_i - E(x)]^2 \times P(x_i)}$$


## Binomial Distribution
- A binomial experiment is one that possesses the following `properties`:
	- The experiment consists of n repeated trials â†’ a fixed number of observations (trials), n
	- e.g., 15 tosses of a coin; 20 patients; 1000 people surveyed
- Each trial results in an outcome that may be `classified` as a success , P or a failure  , q (hence the name, binomial); only TWO outcomes


$$ q = 1 - p $$
$$P(X) = C_x^n p^x q^{n-x}$$
$$mean , E(X) = \mu = np$$
$$variance , V(X) = \sigma^2 = npq$$
$$Standart deviation , SD(X) = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$$


## Poisson Distribution
$$P(X = x) = e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}$$
$$mean , \mu = \lambda$$
$$variance , \sigma^2 = \lambda$$
$$standart Deviation , \sigma = \sqrt{\lambda}$$
