# Correlation
- Co-relation
- The relationship between 2 variables
- Measured with correlation coefficient
- ex : Pearson Product-Moment Correlation

### Types of Correlation
- Positive Correlation
	- High values of X tend to be associated with `high values` of Y
	- As X increase , `Y increases`
- Negative Correlation
	- High values of X tend to be associated with `low values` of Y
	- As X increase, `Y decrease`
- No Correlation
	- `No consistent tendency` for values on Y to increase or decrease as X increase

### When is it used ?

Most often in non-experimental situations and field settings
- in these situations it can only tell us about association, not causation
- Scatter plot can be used

### Types of correlation
- Pearson Product Moment Correlation for continuous data
- Spearman's Rank Correlation
- Point-biserial correlation for dichotomous and continuous data
- Phi-coefficient
- Multiple correlation
- Intra-class correlation
- Canonical correlation
