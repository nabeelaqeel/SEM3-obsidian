# Descriptive statistics 

## Overview
- Description Statistics are used by researchers to Report on Populations and Samples
- By summarizing information , descriptive statistics speed up and simplify comprehension of a group's characteristics
## Sample vs Population

### Types of descriptive statistics : 
- Organize Data
	- Tables 
		- Frequency Distributions
		- Relative Frequency 
	- Graph
		- Bar Chart or Histogram
		- Stem and Leaf Plot
		- Frequency Polygon
- Summarize Data
	- Central Tendency
	- Variation

### Summarizing Data
- Central Tendency 
	- Mean 
	- Median
	- Mode
- Variation
	- Range
	- Interquartile Range
	- Variance
	- Standard Deviation

### Box Plot
- A way to graphically portray almost all the descriptive statistics at once is the box-plot
- A box-plot shows :
	- Upper and lower quartiles
	- Mean
	- Median
	- Range
	- Outliers

## Hypothesis
- What is hypothesis testing ?
- Interpreting and selecting significance level 
- Type I and Type II errors
- One tailed and two tailed tests

### What is hypothesis testing ? 
- Hypothesis testing refers to 
	1. Making an assumption , called hypothesis , about a population parameter
	2. Collecting sample data
	3. Calculating a sample statistic
	4. Using the sample statistic to evaluate the hypothesis ( how likely is it that our hypothesized parameter is correct . To test the validity of our assumption we determine the difference between the hypothesized parameter and the sample value)

### Hypothesis Testing 
- Null Hypothesis , $H_0$
	- State the hypothesized value of the parameter before sampling 
	- The assumption we wish to test ( or the assumption we are trying to reject)
	- E.g population mean , $\mu = 20$
	- There is no difference between coke and diet coke
- Alternative hypothesis , $H_A$
	- All the possible alternatives other than the null hypothesis
	- E.g : $\mu \neq 20$ ,  $\mu > 20$ ,  $\mu < 20$
	- There is a difference between coke and diet coke

### Null Hypothesis 
- represent a theory that has been put forward either because it is believed to be true or because it is used as a basis for an argument and has not been proven
- For example , in a clinical trial of a new drug , the null hypothesis might be the new drug is no better , on average , than the current drug 
- $H_0$ : There is no difference between the two drugs on an average

### Alternative Hypothesis
- statement of what a statistical hypothesis test is set up to establish
	- For example :  in the clinical trial of new drug , alternative hypothesis might be that the new drug has a different effect , on average , compared to that of the current drug
- $H_A$ : two drugs have different effects , on average 
- or 
- $H_A$ : the new drugs is better than the current drug , on overage
- The result of the hypothesis test
	- Reject $H_0$ in favour of $H_A$ or Do not reject $H_0$


### Selecting and interpreting significance level
1. Deciding on a criterion for accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis
2. `Significance level `refers to the percentage of sample means that is outside prescribe limits . 
	- E.g : testing a hypothesis at 5% level of significance mean 
		- That we reject null hypothesis if it falls in the two regions of area 0.025
		- Do not reject the null hypothesis if it falls within the region of are 0.95
3. The higher the level of significance , the higher is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. 

### Type I and Type II errors
- Type I error : refer to the situation when we `reject the null hypothesis` when it is true
	- E.g $H_0$ : there is no difference between the two drugs on average 
	- Type I error will occur if we conclude that the two drugs  produce different effects when actually there isn't a difference 
- Type II error : refers to the situation when we `accept the null hypothesis` when it is false
- $H_0$ : there is no difference between the two drugs on average
- Type II error will occur if we conclude that the two drugs produce the same effect when actually there is a difference

### Type I and Type II errors : example
- Your null hypothesis is that the battery for a heart pacemaker has an average life of 300 days, with the alternative hypothesis that the average life is more than 300 days. You are the quality control manager for the battery manufacturer.
	- Would you rather make a Type I error or a Type II error?
	- Based on your answer to part (a), should you use a high or low significance level?

- Given $H_0$ : average life of pacemaker = 300 days, and $H_A$: Average life of pacemaker > 300 days

	- It is better to make a Type II error (where $H_0$ is false i.e average life is actually more than 300 days but we accept $H_0$ and assume that the average life is equal to 300 days)
	- As we increase the significance level $\alpha$ we increase the chances of making a type I error. Since here it is better to make a type II error we shall choose a low $\alpha$.

### 2 Tailed Test
- `Two tailed test` will reject the null hypothesis if the sample mean is significantly higher or lower than the hypothesized mean
- Appropriate when $H_0 : \mu = \mu_0$ and $H_A : \mu \neq \mu_0$
- E.g : The manufacturer of light bulbs want to produce light bulbs with a mean life of 1000 hours . If the lifetime is shorter he will lose customers to the competition and if it is longer then  he will incur a high cost of production . He does not want to deviate significantly from 1000 hours in either direction .
- Thus he selects the hypotheses as 
	- $H_0 : \mu = 1000$ hours and $H_A : \mu \neq 1000$ hours
	- and uses a two tail test

### 1 tailed test
- `A one-sided test` is a statistical hypothesis test in which the values for which we can reject the null hypothesis, $H_0$ are located entirely in one tail of the probability distribution
- `Lower tailed test` will reject the null hypothesis if the sample mean is significantly lower than the hypothesized mean
- Appropriate when $H_0 : \mu = \mu_0$ and $H_A : \mu < \mu_0$
- E.g : A wholesalers buys light bulbs from the manufacturer in large lots and decides not to accept a lot unless the mean life is at least 1000 hours
- $H_0 : \mu = 1000$ hours and $H_A : \mu < 1000$ hours and uses a lower tail test
- I.e he rejects $H_0$ only if the mean life of sampled bulbs is significantly below 1000 hours

- `Upper tailed test` will reject the null hypothesis if the sample mean is significantly higher than the hypothesized mean
- Appropriate when $H_0 : \mu = \mu_0$ and $H_A : \mu > \mu_0$
- E.g : A highway safety engineer decides to test the load bearing capacity of a 20 year old bridge . The minimum load-bearing capacity of the bridge must be at least 10 tons . 
- $H_0 : \mu = 10$ tons and $H_A : \mu > 10$ tons and uses an upper tail test
- I.e : He rejects $H_0$ only if the mean load bearing capacity of the bridge is significantly higher than 10 tons
