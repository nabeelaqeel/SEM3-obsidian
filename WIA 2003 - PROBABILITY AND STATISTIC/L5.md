## Overview 
- A common goal surveys and other data collecting tools is `to collect data from smaller part of a larger group` , so we can learn something about the larger group
 - In this section we will look at some of the ways to `describe data`

## Definitions
- `Data` : Observations (such as measurements , genders , survey response ) that have been collected
- `Statistics` : A collection of methods for planning experiments , obtaining data , and then organizing , summarizing , presentation , analyzing , interpreting , and drawing conclusions based on the data 
- `Populations` : 
	- The complete collection of all elements (scores , people , measurements , and so on ) to be studied
	- The collection is complete in the sense that it includes all subjects to be studied
- `Census` : The collection of data from every member of the population
- `Sample` : A sub-collection of elements drawn from a population

## Key concepts
- Sample data must be collected in an appropriate way, such as through a process of `random` selection
- If sample data are `not collected in an appropriate way` , the data may be so completely `useless` that no amount of statistical torturing can salvage them 

- `Parameter` :
	- A numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a population
	- A parameter is any summary number , like an average or percentage , that describes the entire `population`
- `Statistic` : 
	- A numerical measurement describing some characteristic of sample 
	- A statistic is any summary number , like an average or percentage , that describes the `sample` 

- `Quantitative data` :
	- Numbers representing counts or measurements
	- Example : Weights of supermodels 
- `Qualitative (or categorical , or attribute ) data` : 
	- Can be separated into different categories that are distinguished by some nonnumeric characteristics  
	- Example : genders (male / female ) of professional athletes

### Quantitative data
- can be distinguished between discrete and continuous types 

- `Discrete` : 
	- Data result when the number of possible values is either a finite number or a 'countable' number of possible values 
	- Example : the number of eggs that hens lay
- `Continuous` :
	- (numerical) data result from infinitely may possible values that correspond to some continuous scale that covers a range of values
	- Example : 
 - `Nominal level of measurement` : 
	 - characterized by data that consist of names , labels , or categories only. The data cannot be arranged in an ordering scheme( such as low to high )
	 - Example : name of book , survey responses yes , no , undecided
- `Ordinal level of measurement` : 
	- involves data that may be arranged in some order but differences between data values either cannot be determined or are meaningless
	- Example : Elementary school , High school , College , and Univerisiti
- `Interval level of measurement` :
	- like the ordinal level , with additional property that the difference between an 
- Quantitative data can further be distinguished between `discrete` and `continuous` types 


## Levels of measurement 
- Another way to classify data is to use levels of measurement
- 4 of these levels are discussed : 
	- Categorical : nominal
	- Continuous : ordinal , interval , ratio

### Summary 
- `Nominal` - categories only
- `Ordinal` - categories with some order
- `Interval` - differences but no natural starting point
- `Ratio` - difference and natural starting point

### Misuse of statistics
- Bad sample
- Small sample
- Misleading graph
- Pictographs
- Distorted percentage
- Loaded question
- Order of questions
- Refusal
- Correlation and Causality
- Self interest study
- Precise number
- Partial pictures
- Deliberate distortions

### Design of Experiment

#### Major Point
- If sample data are not collected in an appropriate way , the data may be so` completely useless `that no amount of statistical tutoring can salvage them
- `Randomness` typically plays a critical role in determining which data to collect

#### Definition
- `Observational study` : Observing and measuring specific characteristic without attempting to modify the subjects being studied
- `Experiment` : Apply some treatment and then observe its effects on the subjects
- `Cross Sectional Study` : Data are observed , measured , and collected at one point in time 
- `Retrospective ( or Case Control ) Study` : Data are collected from the past by going back in time
- `Prospective ( or Longitudinal or Cohort ) Study` : Data are colllected in the future from groups (called cohort) sharing common factors

#### Controlling effects of variables
- `Blinding` : Subject does not know he or she is receiving a treatment or placebo
- `Blocks` : Group of subjects with similar characteristic
- `Completely Randomized Experimental Design` : Subject are put into blocks through a process of random selection
- `Rigorously Controlled Design` : Subjects are very carefully chosen

### Replication and sample size
- `Replication`  : Repetition of an experiment when there are enough subjects to recognize the differences in different treatments
- `Sample Size` : Use a sample size that is large enough to see the true nature of any effects and obtain that sample using an appropriate method, such as one based on randomness
#### Definition
- Random Sample : Members of the population are selected in such a way that each individual member has an `equal chance` of being selected
- `Simple Random Sample (of size n )` : Subjects selected in such a way that every possible sample of the same size n has the same chance of being chosen

### Methods of sampling
- Random 
- Systematic
- Convenience
- Stratified
- Cluster

### Instrumentation
- The process of `preparing to collect data` is  called instrumentation
- It involved the selection of the method by which data will be collected , as well as the procedures and conditions for collecting them

#### Definition
- `Validity` : Defensibility of the inferences a researcher can make from a study using an instrument
- `Reliability` : Reliability refers to consistency of results. Does repeating it produce the same results?
- `Objectivity` : The absence of subjective bias on the part of the researcher. E.g. a supporter of a party may report different results
