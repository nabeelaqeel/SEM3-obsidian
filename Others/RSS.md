this explanation is going to be in two steps. First: what is RSS? Second: what is an RSS _feed_? They're two slightly different things, but since an RSS feed uses an RSS, it's important to understand both.

So first about RSS. The RSS is a file on a website that lists that website's content. RSS lists a bunch of metadata on the content, such as the title, date of submission, and the URL that leads to the actual content. Not any list will do; an RSS is written in a standardized way which makes it easy for programs to read it. These can be programs on the website the RSS belongs to, but can also be programs from other computers (like other websites or your personal devices). Because RSS is a standardized format, anyone can make a program that reads any RSS and use that data for pretty much anything (that doesn't change the original).

An RSS feed is either (1) a list created by one of those other programs by gathering data from various websites' RSS or (2) a curated and sorted list made on the website itself by filtering from their own RSS (eg only the podcasts, not the blogposts). An RSS feed is written in the same format as the RSS, the primary difference is that an RSS feed selects and sorts content while the RSS contains _everything_.

Most webbrowsers come with a feature allowing you to make one or more RSS feeds. You simply tell the program what websites' RSS or RSS feeds should be checked when called upon, and whenever you ask the program to show the list, it will collect all that data and present it to you (usually with the most recent stuff at the top, but this may be something the user can change in the settings).

RSS is a very popular format in podcasting and webcomics, because in addition to allowing their audiences to quickly get updates whenever they are made, many websites and programs that collect podcasts or webcomics to present to users (like Google Podcasts) use RSS feeds to update their website with another website's content. RSS also allows you to easily add content to e-mail newsletters or can be used for collecting content for a news app on a smartphone.

Not only is RSS a very convenient way to pass updates between websites, its use is so widespread that if you want to have those kinds of features on your website you don't really have the option of ignoring it. If you want your podcast on Google Podcasts, your website needs an RSS feed that lists your podcasts from your website so Google Podcasts knows how to list your podcast. And if you already have an RSS feed for your podcast, users who prefer to use their own RSS feed software can call on your RSS feed too and incorporate it into their personal feed.

So the popularity and endurance of the RSS format stems not only from the convenience of the system, but its popularity is also self-reinforcing. As more systems use it, more systems benefit from using it so more systems will use it in the future. Even if RSS stops being used by consumers altogether RSS will be powering the back end of many websites and programs that primarily collect content from other places for a long time still.
