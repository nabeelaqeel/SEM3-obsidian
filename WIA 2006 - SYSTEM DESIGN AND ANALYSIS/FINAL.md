## PASKETUM TIPS

- What sdlc is (what it stands for)
- Identify the sdlc phases (what are they about or what it means, how to describe, the tasks for each phase, give examples (rasanya dia minta describe each phase)

- identify if we were to develop a system, what are the stages/events that we need to do (e.g. purchase request letter REMEMBER THIS why we need this purchase request letter?.., depends on the context lah mcm what type of system)
------purchase request later, purchase order letter, invoice, goods receive report

- dfd (remember level 0, level 1, level 2)
- how to expand dfd to detailed one
- understand the question, get the context

- prototyping 
- what is prototype
- how is it relevant in the context of sad
- why is it important??? (If u have a prototype, it helps you spell out what's wrong with the design, determine  the features that should be included, UX, helps we find out what to fix)
- define the benefits of prototyping!
- e.g. you can have user involvement, identify issues early, improve communication among the stakeholders 
- how would you use prototype to develop certain application (e.g. finance application)
- what are the steps i would take (how u implement the prototype)

- after getting requirements , you can have low fidelity prototype (sketches)
- high fidelity prototype after u get feedbacks about what modules should be in there (interactive mcm figma) --> feedback session (redesign based on feedback)

- implementation 
- migrating from old system to new system
- the installation strategies used to do the installation (direct installation, parallel installation, single location installation, phase installation) .. know what are these 
- diagrams to describe (tgk lecture)

### **3. Stages & Events Related to Purchase Request Letter**

A **Purchase Request Letter** is used to request approval for buying products or services, especially when developing a system.

#### **How & Why We Use It?**

- Used by businesses when they need approval for purchasing software, hardware, or services.
- Helps streamline procurement and ensures accountability.

#### **Flow/Process of Purchasing a System**

8. **Purchase Request Letter** → Sent to the finance/procurement department.
9. **Approval** → Management reviews and approves the request.
10. **Purchase Order (PO)** → Sent to suppliers to confirm the purchase.
11. **Invoice** → Supplier sends an invoice to the finance department.
12. **Payment Processing** → Finance department processes the payment.
13. **Goods Received Report (GRR)** → Warehouse or department confirms product receipt.
14. **System Development or Implementation Begins**.

---

### **4. Purchase Order Letter (To Suppliers)**

- A formal document issued to a supplier, confirming the purchase of goods/services.
- Includes details like item description, quantity, price, and payment terms.
- Example:
    
    ```
    Subject: Purchase Order for Software Development Services
    
    Dear [Supplier Name],
    
    We are pleased to issue this purchase order for the development of a financial management system. Please find the details below:

### **5. System Purchase & Finance Department Invoicing**

- Once a system is purchased, the finance department processes the invoice to pay the supplier.
- **Why It’s Important?** Ensures proper tracking of financial transactions and prevents unauthorized purchases.

---

### **6. Good Receive Report (GRR)**

- When the system is delivered, the receiving department (warehouse or IT team) checks the quality and confirms receipt.
- **Why It’s Important?** Ensures the product meets the requirements before payment is finalized.

---

### **7. Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) - Level 0, 1, 2**

A **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** visually represents the flow of data in a system.

#### **How to Expand a DFD?**

- **Level 0**: High-level overview of the system.
- **Level 1**: Expands Level 0 by showing main processes.
- **Level 2**: Further details each process from Level 1.

#### **Example for an E-commerce System:**

- **DFD Level 0**: Shows "User," "Order Processing," and "Payment System."
- **DFD Level 1**: Expands "Order Processing" into "Add to Cart," "Checkout," and "Generate Invoice."
- **DFD Level 2**: Further expands "Checkout" into "Enter Address," "Choose Payment Method," and "Confirm Order."

---

### **8. Prototyping in System Analysis & Design**

#### **What is a Prototype?**

- A prototype is an early version of a system used to test and refine features.
- Helps in understanding system functionality before full development.

#### **Relevance in System Design**

- Helps visualize how the system will look and function.
- Identifies usability issues early.

#### **Why Prototyping is Important?**

- **Identifies issues early** → Helps detect flaws before development.
- **Stakeholders can review and suggest changes** → Improves communication.
- **Reduces development costs** → Fixing problems early is cheaper.

---

### **9. Implementing Prototyping in Application Development**

15. **Survey the Users** → Gather requirements.
16. **Create a Sketch or Wireframe** → Low-fidelity representation.
17. **Get Feedback** → Ask users and stakeholders for input.
18. **Develop a High-Fidelity Prototype** → Interactive model using tools like Figma or Adobe XD.
19. **Test & Improve** → Identify and resolve issues before full development.

#### **Example (Finance App)**

- **Low-Fidelity Prototype**: Sketch of login screen, transaction page.
- **High-Fidelity Prototype**: Interactive app with clickable elements.
- **User Feedback**: Stakeholders test the prototype before actual coding.

---

### **10. Installation Strategies for New System Implementation**

When switching from an old system to a new one, different installation strategies can be used:

20. **Direct Installation (Big Bang)**
    
    - The old system is immediately replaced with the new system.
    - **Risk**: High risk if the new system fails.
    - **Example**: Upgrading a university’s online learning portal overnight.
21. **Parallel Installation**
    
    - Both old and new systems run together for a period.
    - **Advantage**: If the new system fails, the old system is still available.
    - **Example**: A hospital runs both old and new patient management systems.
22. **Phased Installation**
    
    - The new system is introduced in stages.
    - **Advantage**: Reduces risk and allows gradual adaptation.
    - **Example**: A bank implements online banking features step by step.
23. **Pilot Installation**
    
    - The new system is tested in a small area before full deployment.
    - **Example**: A retailer tests a new billing system in one store before rolling it out nationwide.

---

### **11. Visual Representation**

To better understand SDLC, prototyping, and system installation, diagrams can be used:

- **Flowchart for Purchasing Process**: Shows steps from request to payment.
- **DFD for System Design**: Explains data flow.
- **Prototype Sketches**: Illustrate app layout.
- **Installation Strategy Comparison Table**: Highlights pros/cons.
