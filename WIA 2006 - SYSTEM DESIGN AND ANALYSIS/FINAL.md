## PASKETUM TIPS

- What sdlc is (what it stands for)
- Identify the sdlc phases (what are they about or what it means, how to describe, the tasks for each phase, give examples (rasanya dia minta describe each phase)

- identify if we were to develop a system, what are the stages/events that we need to do (e.g. purchase request letter REMEMBER THIS why we need this purchase request letter?.., depends on the context lah mcm what type of system)
------purchase request later, purchase order letter, invoice, goods receive report

- dfd (remember level 0, level 1, level 2)
- how to expand dfd to detailed one
- understand the question, get the context

- prototyping 
- what is prototype
- how is it relevant in the context of sad
- why is it important??? (If u have a prototype, it helps you spell out what's wrong with the design, determine  the features that should be included, UX, helps we find out what to fix)
- define the benefits of prototyping!
- e.g. you can have user involvement, identify issues early, improve communication among the stakeholders 
- how would you use prototype to develop certain application (e.g. finance application)
- what are the steps i would take (how u implement the prototype)

- after getting requirements , you can have low fidelity prototype (sketches)
- high fidelity prototype after u get feedbacks about what modules should be in there (interactive mcm figma) --> feedback session (redesign based on feedback)

- implementation 
- migrating from old system to new system
- the installation strategies used to do the installation (direct installation, parallel installation, single location installation, phase installation) .. know what are these 
- diagrams to describe (tgk lecture)

## AIMAN TIPS


[  ] Describe what is sdlc
[  ] Need to know all about sdlc phases in detail
[  ] Give example👆🏻
[  ] What are the stages/events that need to us purchase request letter(how,why we are using,how it help on buying/develop a system...e.g.system how to develop a business
[  ] Purchase order letter-->suppliers
[  ] During buying the system,finance dept will *invoice*to the supplier
[  ] Good receive report from department/warehouse
[  ] Basically, need to know the flow/process👆🏻
[  ] Dfd level 0,1,2-->how to expand it
[  ] Question:develop/establish the process
[  ] Prototyping,wat is prototype,how is relevant in the context of analysis n design,how the system looks, the main functions, understand the concept,can check what's wrong with the device, how we can fix it in the beginning stage
[  ] Idea:visual
[  ] Define/why prototype is important
[  ] Identify the issue at the beginning (when using prototype)
[  ]  Stakeholder can detect in the beginning
[  ]  Improve the communication among the stakeholders
[  ] How u implement prototype to develop the application
[  ] E.g:finance
[  ] Do the survey first
[  ] Sketch->ask audience->High fidelity (interactive)
[  ]  During the implementation, process changing from old system to new system->installation strategie that we can use in order to do the installation...refer to direct installation, parallel installation,single installation,phase installation
[  ]  Good to hv diagram while explaining
