# Determining System Requirements

## Introduction
### Analysis has 2 subphases
- `Requirements determination`
- `Requirements structuring`
### Characteristics of a good analyst : 
1. `Impertinence` - question everything
2. `Impartiality` - consider all issues to find the best solution
3. `Relax constraints` - assume anything is possible and eliminate the infeasible
4. `Attention to detail` - every fact must fit with every other fact
5. `Reframing` - challenge yourself to look at the organization in new ways
### System analysts need to understand :
1. `Business objectives `that drive what and how work is done
2. Information people need to do their jobs
3. The `data` ( definition , volume , size) handled in support of jobs
4. Data transformation and storage (when , how , by whom)
5. Data handling dependencies and sequences
6. Data handling and processing rules
7. `Policies` and guidelines that describe the nature of the business and market and the environment it operates in 
8. `Key events` that affect data values and when they occur
### Deliverables for Requirement Determination
1. Information collected from `conversation with or observations of users` : interview transcripts , notes from observation , meeting minutes
2. `Existing written information` business mission and strategy statements, sample business forms and reports and computer displays , procedure manuals, job descriptions , training manuals, flowcharts and documentation of existing systems, consultant report
3. `Computer-based information` : results from JAD (Joint Application Design) sessions, reports of existing systems , and displays and report from system prototypes
### Traditional Methods of Collecting System Requirements
1. `Individually interview `people informed about the operation and issues of the current system and future systems need .
2. `Interview groups` of people with diverse needs to find synergies and contrasts among system requirements
3. `Observe workers` at selected times to see how data are handled and what information people need to do their jobs
4. `Study business documents` to discover reported issues , policies , rules , and directions as well as concrete examples of the use of data and information in the organization.
### Guidelines for Effective Interviewing
1. Plan the interview
	- Prepare interviewee : appointment , priming questions
	- Prepare checklist, agenda , and questions
2. Listen carefully and take notes ( record if permitted)
3. Review note within 48 hours of interview 
4. Seek diverse views
### Interviewing and Listening
- `Open-ended questions `- questions in interviews that have no prespecified answers
- `Closed-ended questions` - questions in interview that ask those responding to choose from among a set of specified response
### Interviewing Guidelines
- Don't `phrase a question` in a way that implies a right or wrong answer
- Listen carefully to what is being said
- Record notes within 48 hours after an interview
- `Don't set expectation`s about the new system unless you know these will be deliverables
- Seek a `variety of perspectives` from the interviews
### Interview Groups
- Drawbacks to interviewing individuals :
	- Reconciling contradiction in information collected
	- New interviews may require new questions
	- Not an efficient process
- Group interview advantages
	- more effective use of time
	- Allows synergy when groups can hear each other
- Primary disadvantage is difficulty in scheduling with multiple people involved
### Directly Observing Users
- Direct observations of workers : 
	- Watching users work at their jobs
	- Observe actual measure of how employees interact with information systems and how they do their jobs
	- More accurate than interview
	- People can change their normal behavior when they know they are being observed
	- Observation cannot be continuous , thus you are getting only a snapshot of how they work
### Analyzing Procedures and Other Documents
- An analysis of existing documents can give you a wealth of information :
	- Problems with existing systems
	- Opportunities to meet new needs with critical information
	- Identify key people of current system
	- Values of organization who help determine priorities desired by different users
	- Special information processing circumstances that might not otherwise be identified
	- Identify left  out features of current software that may lead to needed features in future systems 
	- Identify processing rules that must be enforced
- A written work procedure describes how a job or task is performed
- `Formal system` : official way a system works as describe in organizational documentation
- `Informal system` : way a system actually works
- Four major documents analyzed when creating a new system : 
1. Written work procedure
2. A form such as the invoice form 
	- Gives crucial information about the nature of the organization
3. A report 
	- Can be used to analyze to determine which data to capture
4. Documents used to describe the system and how it is used
	- Examples include flowcharts, data dictionaries , user manuals
### Comparison of Observation and Document Analysis
### Contemporary Methods for Collecting System Requirements
- Bringing session users , sponsors , analysts, and other together in a JAD session to discuss and review system requirement
- Iteratively developing system prototypes that refine the understanding of system requirement in concrete terms by showing working version of system features
