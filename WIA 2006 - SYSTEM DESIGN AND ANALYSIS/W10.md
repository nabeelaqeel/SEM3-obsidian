### Three types of system feedback:
- Status information: keep user informed of what’s going on, helpful when user has to wait for response
- Prompting cues: tell user when input is needed, and how to provide the input
- Error or warning messages: inform user that something is wrong, either with data entry or system operation

– People who will use the system as part of their daily 
lives
• User Training
