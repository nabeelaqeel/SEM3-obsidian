### Three types of system feedback:
- Status information: keep user informed of what’s going on, helpful when user has to wait for response
- Prompting cues: tell user when input is needed, and how to provide the input
- Error or warning messages: inform user that something is wrong, either with data entry or system operation

### Documenting the System, Training Users, and Supporting Users
• Two audiences for final documentation:
– `Information systems personne`l who will maintain the 
system throughout its productive life
– People who will use the system as part of their daily 
lives
• User Training
– Application-specific
– General for operating system and off-the-shelf 
software

### Software Application Testing
•A master test plan is developed during the 
analysis phase
•During the design phase, unit, system and 
integration test plans are developed
•The actual testing is done during implementation
•Written test plans provide improved 
communication among all parties involved in 
testing

### Seven Different Types of Tests
• Software application testing is an umbrella 
term that covers several types of tests
• Static or dynamic techniques
–Static testing means that the code being tested is not 
executed
–Dynamic testing involves execution of the code
• Automated testing vs. manual testing
–Automated means computer conducts the test
–Manual means that people complete the test
1. Inspections – testing technique in which 
participants examine program code for 
predictable language-specific errors
2. Walk-throughs (code walk-throughs) 
should be done frequently when pieces of 
work are reviewed and before formal 
testing. It is an informal process
3.  Desk checking – testing technique in which the 
program code is sequentially executed manually 
by the reviewer
4. Unit testing – process of testing each module 
alone in an attempt to discover any errors in its 
code
5. Integration testing – process of bringing 
together all of the modules that a program 
comprises for testing purposes. Modules are 
typically integrated in a top-down, incremental 
fashion.
6. System testing – bringing together of all of the 
programs that a system comprises for testing 
purposes. Programs are typically integrated in 
a top-down, incremental fashion.
7. Stub testing – technique used in testing 
modules, especially where modules are written 
and tested in a top-down fashion, where a few 
lines of code are used to substitute for 
subordinate modules

### aThe Testing Process (1 of 2)
• Two important things to remember when 
testing information systems:
1. The purpose of testing is to confirm that the system 
satisfies requirements
2. Testing must be planned
• A test case is a specific scenario of transactions, 
queries, or navigation paths that represent a typical, 
critical, or abnormal use of the system
– Should be repeatable
– Need to determine if new software work with other 
existing software
•Testing harness – automated testing 
environment used to review code for errors, 
standards violations, and other design flaws
–Greatly enhances the testing process because it can 
automatically expand the scope of the tests beyond 
the current development platform

### Acceptance Testing by Users (1 of 2)
•Acceptance testing – process whereby actual 
users test a completed information system, the 
end result of which is the users’ acceptance of it
•Alpha testing – user testing of a completed 
information system using simulated data
•Beta testing – user testing of a completed 
information system using real data in the real 
user environment

Installation
• Installation – organizational process of 
changing over from the current information 
system to a new one
• Four installation strategies:
– Direct installation
– Parallel installation
– Single-location installation
– Phased installation
Installation
•Direct installation – changing over from the old 
information system to a new one by turning off 
the old system when the new one is turned on
–Users at the mercy of the new system
–Very risky installation
–Least expensive installation

Installation (3 of 9)
•Parallel installation – running the old 
information system and the new one at the same 
time until management decides the old system 
can be turned off
–Safest approach but very expensive
–Outputs are compared with each system

Installation
13.3 Apply four installation strategies: direct, parallel, single-location, and phased 
installation
•Single-location installation – trying out a new 
information system at one site and using the 
experience to decide if and how the new system 
should be deployed throughout the organization
–Considered a middle-or-the-road approach
–Usually a branch office or one department
–Once successful then rolled out to entire 
company
–Results in extra work for staff

Each Location)

Installation
•Phased installation – changing from the old 
information system to the new one incrementally, 
starting with one or a few functional components 
and then gradually extending the installation to 
cover the whole new system
–An incremental approach (also called staged)
–Usually implemented in a sequence approach
–Requires careful version control

Planning Installation
13.3 Apply four installation strategies: direct, parallel, single-location, and phased 
installation
• Of special interest during installation is the 
conversion of data
– Must be error free, combined with new data 
and loaded into files
– May require current systems to be shut 
down
– Involves getting people to change the way 
they work

Documenting the System
•System documentation – detailed information 
about a system’s design specifications, its 
internal workings, and its functionality
•User documentation – written or other visual 
information about an application system, how it 
works, and how to use it

Training and Supporting Users
•Support – providing ongoing educational and 
problem-solving assistance to information system 
users. For in-house developed systems, support 
materials and jobs will have to be prepared or 
designed as part of the implementation process. 

•Resident expert
•Traditional instructor-led classroom training
•E-learning/distance learning
•Blended learning (combination of instructor-led 
and e-learning)
•Software help components
•External sources, such as vendors

Automating Support
• Vendor’s have automated support to users in order 
to cut costs
• Ways vendor’s have automated support:
– Forums offered over the Internet
– Voice-response systems allow users to navigate option 
menus
– Vendor knowledge bases
• Help desk – single point of contact for all user 
inquiries and problems about a particular 
information system or for all users in a particular 
department (non automated)

Organizational Issues in Systems 
Implementation
• Implementation effort sometimes fails because:
– Employees don’t use the new system
– Employee dissatisfaction with new system
• Important factors to implementation success 
include:
– Commitment to the project
– Commitment to change (willingness to change 
behaviors)
– Meeting user expectations
