### 5 Types of Maintenance
- `Maintenance`: changes made to a system to `fix` or `enhance` its functionality
- `Corrective maintenance` : changes made to a system to `repair` flaws in its design, coding, or implementation
- `Adaptive maintenance` : changes made to a system to `evolve` its functionality to changing business needs or technologies
- `Perfective maintenance` : changes made to a system to `add` new features or to improve performance
- `Preventative maintenance` : changes made to a system to `avoid` possible future problems
