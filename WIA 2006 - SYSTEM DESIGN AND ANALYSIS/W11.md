![../images/Pasted image 20250102103542.png](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250102103542.png)

3 Purpose
- To convert final physical system specifications into working and reliable software
- To document work that has been done
- To provide help for current and future users

### Deliverable
1. Coding
	-  Code
	- Program documentation
2. Testing
	- Test scenarios (test plan) and test data
	- Results of program and system testing
3. Installation
	- User guides
	- User training plan
	- Installation and conversion plan
		- Software and hardware installation schedule
		- Data conversion plan
		- Site and facility remodeling plan
### The Testing Process
2 important to remember 
1. The purpose of testing is to confirm that the system satisfies requirement
2. Testing must be planned

A test case is a specific scenario of transactions, queries , or navigation paths that represent a typical critical , or abnormal use of the system
- should be repeatable
- Need to determine if new software work with other existing software

### Acceptance Testing By Users
- `Acceptance testing` : process whereby actual users test a completed information system, the end result of which is the user's acceptance of it
- `Alpha testing` : user testing of a completed information system using simulated data
- `Beta testing` : user testing of a completed information system using real data in real user environment

### Installation
- Installation : organizational process of changing over from the current information system to a new one

### 4 installation strategies :
- `Direct installation` : changing over from the old information system to anew one by turning off the old system when the new one is turned on
	- User at the mercy of the new system
	- very risky installation
	- Least expensive installation
	- ![../images/Pasted image 20241226105331.png](../images/Pasted%20image%2020241226105331.png)

 - `Parallel installation` : running the old information system and new one at the same time until management decides the old system can be turn off 
	- safest approach but very expensive
	- output are compared with each system
	- ![../images/Pasted image 20241226105506.png](../images/Pasted%20image%2020241226105506.png)

- `Single-location installation` : trying out a new information system at one site and using the experience to decide if and how the new system should be deployed throughout the organization
	- considered the middle-or-the-road approach
	- Usually the branch office or one department
	- Once successful then rolled out to entire company
	- Result in extra work for stuff
	- ![../images/Pasted image 20241226105620.png](../images/Pasted%20image%2020241226105620.png)


- `Phased installation` : changing from the old information system to new one incrementally , starting with one or a few functional components and then gradually extending the installation to cover the whole new system
	- An incremental approach ( or staged)
	- Usually implement in sequence approach 
	- Require careful version control

### Planning Installation

Of special interest during installation is the conversion of data
- Must be error free, combined with new data and loaded into files
- May require current systems to be shut down 
- Involve getting people change the way they work 


### Documenting the System
- System documentation : detailed information about a system's design specification , its internal working , how it works , and how to use it 
- User documentation : written or 

### Training and Supporting Users
- Support : 

### Types of Training
- Resident expert
- Traditional instructor-led classroom training
- E-learning / distance learning
- Blended learning ( combination of instructor-led and e-learning)
- Software help components
- External sources , such as vendors


### Automating Support
- Vendor's have automated support to users in order to cut costs
- Way vendor's have automated support : 
	- Forum offered over the Internet
	- Voice-response systems allow users to navigate option menus
