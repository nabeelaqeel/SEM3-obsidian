# Identification of System Development Project
- `Project Manager` :systems analyst with a diverse set of skills—management, leadership, technical, conflict management, and customer relationship—who is responsible for initiating, planning, executing, and closing down a project
- `Project` : planned undertaking of related activities to reach an objective that has a beginning and an end
- `Deliverable` : end product of an SDLC phase
- `System Service Request(SSR)` : standard from for requesting or proposing systems development work within an organization
- `Feasibility study` :  study that determines whether a requested system makes economic and operational sense for an organization

### Skills of a Project Manager
1. Leadership
2. Management
3. Customer relations
4. Technical problem solving
5. Conflict management
6. Team management
7. Risk and change management

---
- Project Management - controlled process of initiating , planning , executing , and closing down a project
- Phases of project management : 
	- Initiating
	- Planning
	- Executing
	- Closing down
### Ten Project Planning Activities 
1. `Describing` Project Scope , Alternatives , and Feasibility
2. Dividing the Project into `Manageable Tasks`
3. `Estimating Resources `and Creating a Resource Plan
4. Developing a `Preliminary Schedule`
5. Developing a `Communication Plan
6. Determining `Project Standards and Procedures`
7. Identifying and Assessing `Risk`
8. Creating a `Preliminary Budget`
9. Developing a `Project Scope Statement`
10. Setting a `Baseline Project Plan`
### Identifying and Selecting System Development Projects
- Identifying and selecting system development project is part of the 1st Phase (Planning) of the SDLC
- Many firms follow a very formal process for selecting projects
- Requests come from variety of sources : 
	- By managers needing to` replace` aging existing systems
	- By managers wanting to make a system more` efficient`
	- By manager needing a `new system`
### Project identifications and selection consists of 3 primary activities : 
1. Identifying potential development projects
	- By key members of top management 
	- By steering committee (top -down source)
	- By user department (bottom-up source)
	- By development group or senior IS manager
2. Classifying and ranking IS development projects
	- Using `value chain analysis` or other evaluation criteria
3. Selecting IS development projects
	- Based on various factor with` short and long-term` projects
	- Numerous factor must be considered
### Characteristic of Alternative Methods
- Top Management 
	- Greater strategic focus
	- Largest project size
	- Longest project duration
	- Enterprise-wise consideration
- Steering Committee
	- Cross-functional focus
	- Greater organization change
	- Formal cost-benefit analysis
	- Larger and riskier projects
- Functional Area
	- Narrow , nonstrategic focus
	- Faster development
	- Fewer users , management layers , and business functions involved
- Development Group
	- Integration with existing system focus
	- Fewer development delays
	- Less concern with cost-benefit analysis
### Possible Evaluation Criteria
1. `Value Chain Analysis` : extent to which activities add value and costs when developing product and/or services
2. `Strategic Alignment` : Extent to which the project is viewed as helping the organization achieves its strategic objectives and long-term goals
3. `Potential Benefits` : Extent to which project is viewed as improving profits , customer service , and so forth , and the duration of these benefits
4. `Resource Availability` : Amount and type of resources the project requires and their availability
5. `Project size / Duration` : Number of individuals and the length of time needed to complete the project
6. `Technical Difficulty / Risks` : Level of technical difficulty to successfully complete the project within given time and resource constraints
### Project Selection Decisions
1. Existing and Available Resources
2. Perceived and Real needs
3. List of Potential and Ongoing Project
4. Current Organizational Environment
5. Evaluation Criteria
- Decision Outcome
1. Accept Project
2. Reject Project
3. Delay Project
4. Refocus Project
5. End-user Development
6. Proof of Concept
### Deliverables and Outcomes
- Primary deliverable from 1st Phase of planning is schedule of specific IS development projects
- Project initiation and planning is next phase
- `Incremental commitment` : strategy in systems analysis and design in which the project is reviewed after each phase and continuation of the project is rejustified
- `Information system planning (ISP)` : orderly means of assessing the information needs of an organization and defining new systems , databases and technologies that will best satisfy those needs.
### Information System Planning is 3-Step Process
- `Step 1` : Current Situations : 
- `Step 2` : Future Situations : 
- `Step 3` : Schedule of Projects :
### Gantt Chart 
- List tasks
- Divide into phases
- List milestone
- Add time
### Using Project Management Software
- Many powerful software tools exist for assisting with project management 
- Microsoft Project is an example that can be used to 
	- Establish a project starting or ending date
	- Enter tasks and assign task relationships
	- Select a scheduling method to review project reports
