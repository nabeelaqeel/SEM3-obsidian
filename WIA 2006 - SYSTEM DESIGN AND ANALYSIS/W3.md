# The Systems Development Environment

## Introduction
- `Information Systems Analysis and Design` :  Defined as the complex , challenging , and simulating organizational process that a  team of business and systems professionals uses to develop and maintain information systems
-` Application Software` : software designed to support organizational function or process
- `Systems Analyst` : Organizational role most responsible for analysis and design of information systems
### Approach to SAD
1. Techniques
2. Methodologies 
3. Tools
### A Modern Approach to SAD
### Developing Information System and System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- System development `methodology `: a standard process followed in an organization to conduct all the steps necessary to analyze , design , implement , and maintain information system 
- SDLC : The traditional methodology used to develop , maintain , and replace information systems
	- Features several phases that mark the progress of the SAD effort
### SDLC
- A circular process ,with the end of the useful life leading to the start of another
- At any given phase the project can return to a previous phase when needed
- Can be an iterative process
1. Planning 
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Maintenance
### Evolutionary Model
- A spiral process in which one is constantly cycling through phases at different level

### Phases of SDLC
1. Planning
	- Need for a new or enhanced system is identified 
	- Need are identified , analyzed , prioritized and arranged
	- Determine the scope of the proposed system
	- Baseline project plan is developed
2. Analysis
	- System requirements are studied from user input and structured 
	- Requires careful study of current systems , manual and computerized , that might be replaced or be enhanced
	- Output is description of the alternative solution recommend by the analysis team 
3. Design 
	 - Analyst converts the alternate solution into logical and physical specifications
	 - `Logical Design` : The design process part that is independent of any specific hardware or software platform
	 - `Physical Design` : The logical specifications of the system from logical design are transformed into technology-specific details from which all programming/system construction can be accomplished
	 - Choices of language , database, and platform are many times already decided by the organization or client
 4. Implementation 
	 - Occurs when the information system is coded , tested, installed  and supported in the organization
	 - New systems become part of the daily activities of the organization
5. Maintenance 
	- The phase in which an information system is systematically repaired and improved
	- Organization's needs may change over time requiring changes to the system based on user's needs
### Products of SDLC Phases
### Analysis-Design-Code-Test Loop
- Traditional Practice
1. Analysis
2. Design
3. Code
4. Test
### Heart of System Development
- Current practice combines analysis, design , and implementation into single process
### SDLC Traditional Waterfall
1. Planning
2. Analysis
3. Logical Design
4. Physical Design
5. Implementation
6. Maintenance
### SDLC Traditional Waterfall Problems
- Once 1 Phase end another begins, going downhill until complete
- Makes it difficult to go back 
- Results in great expense to make changes
- Role of system users or customers narrowly defined
- Focused on deadlines
### Agile Methodologies
- 3 Key `Principles` : 
	1. A focus on adaptive rather than predictive methodologies
	2. A focus on people rather than roles
	3. A focus on self-adaptive process
### Agile Manifesto
 - The agile methodologies group argues that software development methodologies adapted from engineering generally do not fit with real world software development
 - The Manifest for Agile Software Development
	 - Seventeen anarchist agree
	 - We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value : 
		 - `Individuals and interaction` over process and tools
		 - `Working software` over comprehensive documentation
		 - `Customer collaboration` over contract negotiation
		 - `Responding to change` over following plan
 - That is , while we value the items on the right , we value the items on the left more , We follow this principles : 
	 - The highest priority is to` satisfy the customer` through early and continuous delivery of valuable` software`
	 - Welcome` changing requirements `, even late in development . Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
	 - Deliver `working software frequently`, from couple of weeks to a couple of months , with a preference to the shorter timescale
	 - Businesspeople projects around` motivated individuals` . Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done . 
	 - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is `face-face conversation`
	 - `Working software` is the primary measure of `progress`
 - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility (easily )
 - Agile processes promote sustainable development . The sponsor ,developers , and users be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
 - `Simplicity` : the art maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential 
 - The best architectures , requirements , and designs emerge from `self-organizing teams`
 - At regular intervals , the team `reflects` on how to become more effective , then tunes and adjust its behavior accordingly

### Agile Methodologies - Not for Everyone Project
- Agile methodologies are not everyone
- Fowler recommends an agile process if your project `involves`
	- `unpredictable` or dynamic requirements
	- responsible and `motivated` developers 
	-` customers who understand` the process and will get involved
### Five Critical Factor : Agile vs Traditional 
1. Size 
2. Criticality
3. Dynamism
4. Personnel
5. Culture
### eXtreme Programming
- Short , incremental development cycles 
- Focus on automated tests written by programmers
- Emphasis on` two-person programming teams`
- `Customers to monitor` the development process
- Relevant part of eXtreme Programming that relate to design specification are 
	1. How planning , analysis , design and construction are all fused into single phase of activity
	2. Its unique way of capturing and presenting system requirement and design specifications
- Coding and Testing are related parts of the same process
- Advantages included : 
	- Increased communications among developers 
	- Higher levels of productivity
	- Higher quality of code
	- Reinforcement of other practices in eXtreme Programming
		- Include code-and-test discipline
### Scrum
- Originated in 1995 by Sutherland and Schwaber
- Most popular methodology for agile (58%)
- Scrum framework includes 
	- Scrum teams with associated roles, events ,artifacts and rules
	- Each team consists of 3 `roles` : 
		- Product owner 
		- Development team
		- Scrum master
- Scrum designed for speed and multiple functional product releases
- Primary unit is the Sprint (runs 2 weeks to a Month)
	- Start with an `8 hour planning meeting`
		- What needs to be delivered by the end of the sprint
		- How will the team accomplish that work
	- Daily Standup : A `15-minute `meeting held to evaluate progress made within the past 24 hours and what needs to be done
	- At the end of the sprint  , 2 additional meetings
		- `The Sprint Review` : (4 hours) focusing on the product , what has been accomplished , and what needs to be done
		- `The Sprint Retrospective`: (3 hours) focusing on team performance and how it can improve
	- 3 primary `artifacts` in the Scrum process
		1. `Product Backlog` : Listing of potential requirement
		2. `Sprint Backlog` : Listing of only items to be addressed in a particular sprint
		3. `Increment `: Represents the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a sprint

### Agile in Practice
- 3 Primary Factors critical for success : 
	- `Delivery strategy `: Continuous delivery of working software in short time scales
	- Following `agile software engineering practices `
	- `Team capability` : Agile principle of building projects around motivated individuals
- Agile development offers managers and programmer more choice in their effort to produce good systems that come in on time and under budget

### Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)
- Based on objects rather than data or processes
- Combines data and processes (called methods) into single entities call objects
- Object : A structure that encapsulates attributes and methods that operate on those attributes
- Inheritance : Hierarchical arrangement of classes enabling subclasses to inherit properties of superclass
- Object class : Logical grouping of objects that have the same attributes and behaviors

### Relational Unified Process (RUP)
- object-oriented systems development methodology
- Based on an iterative , incremental approach to system development 
- RUPs 4 Phases 
	- Inception
	- Elaboration
	- Construction
	- Transition

### Our Approach to System Development 
- Criticisms of SDLC include
	- Forced time phases on intangible and dynamic processes were doomed to fail
	- Life-cycle reliance has resulted in massive amounts of process and documentation
	- Cycles are not necessarily waterfalls
