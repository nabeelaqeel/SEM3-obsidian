# Initiating and Planning System Development Projects

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250205222303.png)
## Introduction
- Project initiation focuses on `activities designed` to assist in organizing a team to conduct project planning

### Elements of Project Initiation 
- Establishing the project `initiation team`
- Establishing  a relationship with the `customer`
- Establishing the project `initiation plan`
- Establishing the `management procedures`
- Establishing the project management `environment and project workbook`
- Developing the `project charter`

### Elements of Project Planning 
- Describing the` project scope , alternative and feasibility`
- Dividing the project into `manageable tasks`
- Estimate `resources` and creating a resource plan 
- Developing a `preliminary schedule`
- Determining` project standards and procedures`
- Identifying and assessing `risk`
- Creating a `preliminary budget`
- Developing the` project scope statement `
- Setting a` baseline project plan` 

## Deliverables and Outcomes
- `Business Care` : `justification` for an information system, presented in terms of the tangible and intangible economic benefits and costs and the technical and organizational feasibility of the proposed system
- `Baseline Prject Plan (BPP) ` : `major outcome` and deliverable from the project initiation and planning phase that contains the best estimate of a project’s scope, benefits, costs, risks, and resource requirements
- `Project Scope Statement (PSS) ` : `document` prepared for the customer that describes what the project will deliver and outlines generally at a high level all work required to complete the project

## Assessing Project Feasibility

- Most feasibility `factors` are represented by the following categories:
	- Economic 
	- Technical 
	- Operational
	- Scheduling
	- Legal and contractual
	- Political
## Assessing Economic Feasibility
- `Economic feasibility` :  process of identifying the `financial benefits` and` costs` associated with a development project
- `Tangible benefit` :  benefit from the creation of an information system that `can be measured in dollars and with certainty`
- Most tangible `benefits` :
	- Cost reduction and avoidance
	- error reduction
	- increased flexibility
	- increased speed of activity
	- improvement of management planning and control
	- opening new markets and increasing sales opportunities
- `Intangible benefit` : benefit derived from the creation of an information system that `cannot be easily measured in dollars or with certainty`
## Determining Project Costs
- `Tangible costs` :  costs associated with an information system that can be measured in dollars and with certainty
- `Intangible costs` : costs associated with an information system that cannot be easily measured in terms of dollars or with certainty
- `Total cost of ownership (TCO)` : cost of owning and operating a system, including the total cost of acquisition, as well as all costs associated with its ongoing use and maintenance
- `One-time costs` : costs associated with project start-up and development or system start-up
- `Recurring cost` : cost resulting from the ongoing evolution and use of a system

## Assessing Technical Feasibility
- `Technical feasibilty` : process of assessing the development organization’s ability to construct a proposed system : 
- Potential `consequences` of not accessing and managing risks can include the following : 
	- Failure to attain expected benefits from the project
	- Inaccurate project cost estimates
	- Inaccurate project duration estimates
	- Failure to achieve adequate system performance levels
	- Failure to adequately integrate the new system with existing hardware, software, organizational procedures

## Assessing Other Feasibility Concerns
- `Operational feasibility` : process of assessing the degree to which a proposed system solves business problems or takes advantage of business opportunities
- `Schedule feasibilty` : process of assessing the degree to which the potential time frame and completion dates for all major activities within a project meet organizational deadlines and constraints for affecting change
- `Legal and contractual feasibility` : process of assessing potential legal and contractual ramifications due to the construction of a system
- `Political feasibility` : process of evaluating how key stakeholders within the organization view the proposed system

## Baseline Project Plan
### Four major sections : 
- `Introduction`
- `System Definition Section`
- `Feasibility Assessment Section`
- `Management Issue Section`
### Reviewing the Baseline Project Plan
- must review the BPP to verify it make sense
- `Walk-through` : `peer group review` of any product created during the systems development process ; also call a structured walk-through
	- not rigid nor formal or long
	- Roles include coordinator , presenter , user ,secretary , standards bearer , and maintenance oracle
	- Can be applied to reviewing BPP, system specifications , logical  and physical designs , program code, test procedures , manuals ,and documentation
	- Ensures formal review points occur during the project
