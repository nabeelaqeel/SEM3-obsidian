- `Process modelling` : graphically representing functions, processes that capture , manipulate , store , and distribute data between a system and components within a system
- `Data flow diagram (DFD)`  : picture of the movement of data between external entities and the processes and data stores within a system

## Overview of Data and Process Modelling Tools 
- System analysts use many graphical techniques to describe an information system 
- 1 of popular method data and modeling
- Data and Modeling process involves 3 tools :
	1. Data Flows Diagrams
	2. Data Dictionary 
	3. Process Descriptions
- `Other graphical tool`s : object models and Entity-relationship Diagrams 
- `Data Flow Diagram` : Diagram that show how the systems stores , process and transform data into useful information
- `Data Dictionary`  : A central storehouse of information about a system's data 
- `Process Descriptions` : A documentation of functional primitive's details , which represents a specific set of processing steps and business logic

## Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
- shows how data moves through an information system but does not show program logic or processing steps 
- A set of DFDs provides a logical model that show what the system does , not how it does it 
- DFD uses various symbols to show how the system transform input data into useful information
- DFD Symbols : 
	- 4 basic symbol 
		- processes
		- data flows 
		- data stores
		- entities
	- There are several versions of DFD symbol exist 
	- Ex : Gane and Sarson  ,  Yourdon

- DFD Symbols: Process Symbol
	- A rectangle with rounded corners
	- The name of the process appears inside the rectangle.
	- The process name identifies a specific function
	- Examples: APPLY RENT PAYMENT, CALCULATE COMMISION, VERIFY ORDER
	- Receives input data and produces output that has a different content, form, or both
	- A process can be procedure or algorithm
	- Contain the business logic, also called business rules
	- Referred to as a black box (because the underlying details and logic of the process are hidden)
	- To show additional levels of detail, can zoom in on a process symbol and create a more in-depth DFD
- DFD Symbols: Data Flow Symbol
	- A data flow is a path for data to move from one path of the IS to another
	- It represents data movement among processes,  data stores and external entities.
	- A line with a single or double arrowhead
	- Data flow name appears above, below, or  alongside the line
	- Examples: DEPOSIT, INVOICE, PAYMENT, STUDENT GRADE, ORDER
	- Represents one or more data items. Example: single data item (student ID Number) or include a set of data (such as class roster with student ID numbers and names)
	- Does not show the detailed content (included in data dictionary)
	- At least one data flow must enter and one data flow must exit each process symbol
	- Must have a process symbol on at least one end
	- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250204002825.png)
	- Three data flow and process combinations you must AVOID (p153):
	- Spontaneous generation
		- No input data flow
	- Black hole
		- Produces no output data flow
	- Gray hole
		- Has at least one input and one output but the input  obviously is insufficient to generate the output shown
- DFD Symbols: Data Store Symbol
	- A flat rectangle that is open on the right side and closed on the left side.
	- The name appear between the lines and identifies the data it contains
	- Examples: STUDENTS, PRODUCTS, DAILY PAYMENTS, PURCHASE ORDERS
	- A data store is used to represent data that the system stores because one or more processes need to use the data at a later time
	- Represents a file or part of database
	- Does not show the detailed content (included in data dictionary)
	- Data store must be connected to a process with data flow
	- Must have at least one incoming and one outgoing data flow
