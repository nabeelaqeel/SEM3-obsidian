# Structured System Process Requirements

- `Process modelling` : graphically representing functions, processes that capture , manipulate , store , and distribute data between a system and components within a system
- `Data flow diagram (DFD)`  : picture of the movement of data between external entities and the processes and data stores within a system

## Overview of Data and Process Modelling Tools 
- System analysts use many graphical techniques to describe an information system 
- 1 of popular method data and modeling
- Data and Modeling process involves 3 tools :
	1. Data Flows Diagrams
	2. Data Dictionary 
	3. Process Descriptions
- Other graphical tools : object models and Entity-relationship Diagrams 
- Data Flow Diagram : Diagram that show how the systems stores , process and transform data into useful information
- Data Dictionary  : A central storehouse of information about a system's data 
- Process Descriptions : A documentation of functional primitive's details , which represents a specific set of processing steps and business logic

## Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
- shows how data moves through an information system but does not show program logic or processing steps 
- A set of DFDs provides a logical model that show what the system does , not how it does it 
- DFD uses various symbols to show how the system transform input data into useful information
- DFD Symbols : 
	- 4 basic symbol 
		- processes
		- data flows 
		- data stores
		- entities
	- There are several versions of DFD symbol exist 
	- Ex : Gane and Sarson  ,  Yourdon
