# SEM 3 Notes Repository

Welcome! This is where I’ve stored all my notes from Semester 3.

### For CSN (Computer Systems and Networks) Students

Check out the **WIA2008 - Advanced Network Technology (ANT)/Lab** section.

This folder contains all the lab configurations I’ve saved for the ANT course. I hope you find these helpful when taking the course!

> Note: Currently, there are no explanations included in the configurations. I’ll add detailed explanations if I find time later. :)
